<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">When</span> I began this Translation, more than two years ago, I had no
intention of publishing it; but as the work progressed, it occurred
to me that Arrian is an Author deserving of more attention from the
English-speaking races than he has yet received. No edition of his
works has, so far as I am aware, ever appeared in England, though on
the Continent many have been published. In the following Translation I
have tried to give as literal a rendering of the Greek text as I could
without transgressing the idioms of our own language. My theory of the
duty of a Translator is, to give the <i>ipsissima verba</i> of his Author
as nearly as possible, and not put into his mouth words which he never
used, under the mistaken notion of improving his diction or his way of
stating his case. It is a comparatively easy thing to give a paraphrase
of a foreign work, presenting the general drift of the original; but no
one, unless he has himself tried it, can understand the difficulty of
translating a classical Author correctly without omission or mutilation.</p>

<p>In the Commentary which I have compiled, continual reference has been
made to the other extant authorities on the history of Alexander,
such as Diodorus, Plutarch, Curtius, Justin, and Aelian; so that I
think I may safely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">vi</a></span> assert that, taking the Translation and the Notes
together, the book forms a complete history of Alexander’s reign. Much
geographical and other material has also been gathered from Herodotus,
Strabo, Pliny, and Ammianus; and the allusions to the places which are
also mentioned in the Old Testament are given from the Hebrew.</p>

<p>As Arrian lived in the second century of the present era, and nearly
five hundred years after Demosthenes, it is not to be expected that he
wrote classical Greek. There are, however, at least a dozen valuable
Greek authors of this century whose works are still extant, and of
these it is a safe statement to make, that Arrian is the best of them
all, with the single exception of Lucian. I have noticed as many of his
deviations from Attic Greek constructions as I thought suitable to a
work of this kind. A complete index of Proper Names has been added, and
the quantities of the vowels marked for the aid of the English Reader.
In the multiplicity of references which I have put into the Notes, I
should be sanguine if I imagined that no errors will be found; but if
such occur, I must plead as an excuse the pressure of work which a
teacher in a large school experiences, leaving him very little energy
for literary labour.</p>

<h2>LIFE AND WRITINGS OF ARRIAN.</h2>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">All</span> we know of Arrian is derived from the notice of him in the
<i>Bibliotheca</i> of Photius, who was Patriarch of Constantinople in
the ninth century, and from a few incidental references in his own
writings. We learn from Suidas that Dion Cassius wrote a biography of
Arrian; but this work is not extant. Flavius Arrianus was born near
the end of the first century of the Christian era, at Nicomedia, the
capital of Bithynia. He became a pupil of the famous Stoic philosopher
Epictetus, and afterwards went to Athens, where he received the surname
of the “younger Xenophon,” from the fact that he occupied the same
relation to Epictetus as Xenophon did to Socrates.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> Not only was he
called Xenophon by others, but he calls himself so in <i>Cynegeticus</i> (v.
6); and in <i>Periplus</i> (xii. 5; xxv. 1), he distinguishes Xenophon by
the addition <i>the elder</i>. Lucian (<i>Alexander</i>, 56) calls Arrian simply
<i>Xenophon</i>. During the stay of the emperor Hadrian at Athens, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 126,
Arrian gained his friendship. He accompanied his patron to Rome, where
he received the Roman citizenship. In consequence of this, he assumed
the name of Flavius.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> In the same way the Jewish historian, Josephus,
had been allowed by Vespasian and Titus to bear the imperial name
Flavius.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></p>

<p>Photius says, that Arrian had a distinguished career in Rome, being
entrusted with various political offices, and at last reaching the
supreme dignity of consul under <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>Antoninus Pius.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> Previous to this
he was appointed (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 132) by Hadrian, Governor of Cappadocia, which
province was soon after invaded by the Alani, or Massagetae, whom he
defeated and expelled.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> When Marcus Aurelius came to the throne,
Arrian withdrew into private life and returned to his native city,
Nicomedia. Here, according to Photius, he was appointed priest to
Demeter and Persephone. He died in the reign of Marcus Aurelius.</p>

<p>The earlier literary efforts of Arrian were philosophical. After
the expulsion of the philosophers from Rome, by Domitian, Epictetus
delivered his lectures at Nicopolis, in Epirus, where it is probable
that Arrian was his pupil.</p>

<p>I. These lectures were published by Arrian, under the title of
<i>Discourses of Epictetus</i>, in eight books, the first four only of which
have come down to us. He tells us himself in the introduction to this
work, that he strove as far as possible to preserve the very words
of his teacher as mementoes of his method of reasoning and diction.
Gellius (xix. 1) speaks of a fifth book of these Discourses.</p>

<p>II. He also compiled <i>The Enchiridion of Epictetus</i>, an abstract of
the philosophy of Epictetus, which is still extant. This manual of
the Stoic moral philosophy was very popular, both among Pagans and
Christians, for many centuries.</p>

<p>III. Another work by Arrian, in twelve books, distinct from the above,
is mentioned by Photius under the title of “Ὁμιλίαι Ἐπικτήτου”,
or <i>Friendly Conversations with Epictetus</i>. Of
this only a few fragments survive.</p>

<p>IV. Another lost work of Arrian on the life and death of Epictetus
is mentioned by Simplicius in the beginning of his Commentary on the
Enchiridion.</p>

<p>V. Besides editing these philosophical works, Arrian <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>wrote many
original books. By far the most important of these is the <i>Anabasis of
Alexander</i>, or the History of Alexander the Great’s Campaigns. This
is one of the most authentic and accurate of historical works. Though
inspired with admiration for his hero, the author evinces impartiality
and freedom from hero-worship. He exhibits great literary acuteness in
the choice of his authorities and in sifting evidence. The two chief
sources from which he drew his narrative were the histories written by
Ptolemy, son of Lagus, and Aristobulus, son of Aristobulus, both of
whom were officers in Alexander’s army. Other authorities quoted by
Arrian himself were:&mdash;Eratosthenes, Megasthenes, Nearchus, Aristus,
and Asclepiades. He also made use of Alexander’s letters, which he
mentions five times;<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> only once, however, quoting the exact words of
the writer. The last authority which he mentions, is the <i>Royal Diary</i>
kept by Eumenes, of Cardia, the private secretary of Philip as well as
of Alexander, and by the historian Diodotus, of Erythrae. It is used by
Arrian only once,<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> as it is by Plutarch.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></p>

<p>VI. The work named <i>Indica</i>, is a description of India, and was usually
united in manuscripts with the Anabasis, as an eighth book. Though
it may be looked upon as a supplement to the Anabasis, Arrian often
refers in the one work to the other.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> From this we may infer that the
author wished the <i>Indica</i> to be considered a distinct book from the
Anabasis; and from the remark in Anab. v. 1, it is clear that it was
composed after the Anabasis. This book is written in the Ionic dialect,
like the History of Herodotus and the Indica of Ctesias. The latter
untrustworthy book Arrian wished to supplant <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>by his own narrative,
principally based on the works of Megasthenes and Nearchus.</p>

<p>VII. Photius mentions among Arrian’s historical works:&mdash;<i>The Events
after Alexander</i>, in ten books, which gives the history of Alexander’s
successors. Photius (cod. 92) has preserved many extracts from this
work.</p>

<p>VIII. <i>Bithynica</i> in eight books, a work often quoted by Eustathius in
his commentaries to the Iliad and to Dionysius Periegetes. In regard
to the contents of this book, Photius (cod. 93) says:&mdash;“The Bithynica
commences from the mythical events of history and comes down as far
as the death of the last Nicomedes, who at his death bequeathed his
kingdom to the Romans, who had never been ruled by a king after the
expulsion of Tarquin.”</p>

<p>IX. <i>Parthica</i>, in seventeen books. See Photius (cod. 58).</p>

<p>X. <i>History of the Alani</i>. See Photius (cod. 93). Only fragments of
this and the <i>Parthica</i> remain.</p>

<p>XI. Besides the large works, we learn from Photius (cod. 93) that
Arrian wrote the biographies of the Corinthian Timoleon and of the
Syracusan Dion. Lucian (Alex. 2), also states that he wrote the life of
Tilliborus, the notorious robber of Asia Minor.</p>

<p>XII. A valuable geographical work by Arrian has come down to us, called
“Περίπλους πόντου Εὐξείνου,” a
description of a voyage round the coasts of the Euxine. This naval
expedition was executed by him as Governor of Cappadocia. The Alani,
or, Albani of the East, a tribe related to the Massagetae, were
threatening to invade his province, and he made this voyage with a
view of fortifying the most important strategic points on the coast.
From section 26 of the Periplus we find that this voyage must have
taken place about the year 131 or 132 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>; for the death of King
Cotys II., noticed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span> in that passage as just dead, is proved by Böckh’s
investigations to have occurred in 131 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> Two other geographical
works, <i>The Periplus of the Red Sea</i> and <i>The Periplus of the Euxine</i>,
formerly ascribed to Arrian, are proved to belong to a later date.</p>

<p>XIII. A work on <i>Tactics</i>, composed 137 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> In many parts this book
agrees nearly verbally with the larger work of Aelian on the same
subject; but Leo Tacticus (vii. 85) expressly mentions the two works as
distinct.</p>

<p>XIV. <i>An Array of Battle against the Alani</i>, is a fragment discovered
in the seventeenth century in the Description of his Battles with the
Alani, who invaded his province, probably 137 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>, as Arrian had
previously feared.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></p>

<p>XV. A small work by Arrian on the Chase, forms a supplement to
Xenophon’s book on the same subject. It is entitled <i>Cynegeticus of
Arrian or the second Xenophon the Athenian</i>.</p>

<p class="tb">The best editions of the Anabasis are the following:&mdash;The <i>editio
princeps</i> by Trincavelli, Venice, 1535; Gerbel, Strassburg, 1539; Henri
Estienne, 1575; N. Blancardus, Amsterdam, 1668; J. Gronovius, Leyden,

<h2>ARRIAN'S PREFACE.</h2>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">I have</span> admitted into my narrative as strictly authentic all the
statements relating to Alexander and Philip which Ptolemy, son of
Lagus,<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> and Aristobulus, son of Aristobulus,<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> agree in making;
and from those statements which differ I have selected that which
appears to me the<span class="pagenum2">7</span> more credible and at the same time the more
deserving of record. Different authors have given different accounts
of Alexander’s life; and there is no one about whom more have
written, or more at variance with each other. But in my opinion the
narratives of Ptolemy and Aristobulus are more worthy of credit than
the rest; Aristobulus, because he served under king Alexander in his
expedition, and Ptolemy, not only because he accompanied Alexander in
his expedition, but also because he was himself a king afterwards, and
falsification of facts would have been more disgraceful to him than to
any other man. Moreover, they are both more worthy of credit, because
they compiled their histories after Alexander’s death, when neither
compulsion was used nor reward offered them to write anything different
from what really occurred. Some statements made by other writers I
have incorporated in my narrative, because they seemed to me worthy of
mention and not altogether improbable; but I have given them merely as
reports of Alexander’s proceedings. And if any man wonders why, after
so many other men have written of Alexander, the compilation of this
history came into my mind, after perusing<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> the narratives of all the
rest, let him read this of mine, and then wonder (if he can).</p>

<h2>BOOK I.</h2>

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Death of Philip and Accession of Alexander.&mdash;His
Wars with the Thracians.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">It</span> is said that Philip died<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> when Pythodemus was archon
at Athens,<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> and that his son Alexander,<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> being then
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>about twenty years of age, marched into Peloponnesus<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a>
as soon as he had secured the regal power. There he
assembled all the Greeks who were within the limits
of Peloponnesus,<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> and asked from them the supreme
command of the expedition against the Persians, an
office which they had already conferred upon Philip. He
received the honour which he asked from all except the
Lacedaemonians,<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> who replied that it was an hereditary
custom of theirs, not to follow others but to lead them.
The Athenians also attempted to bring about some
political change; but they were so alarmed at the very
approach of Alexander, that they conceded to him even
more ample public honours than those which had been
bestowed upon Philip.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> He then returned into Macedonia
and busied himself in preparing for the expedition
into Asia.</p>

<p>However, at the approach of spring (<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 335), he
marched towards Thrace, into the lands of the Triballians
and Illyrians,<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> because he ascertained that these nations
were meditating a change of policy; and at the same
time, as they were lying on his frontier, he thought it
inexpedient, when he was about to start on a campaign
so far away from his own land, to leave them behind him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>without being entirely subjugated. Setting out then
from Amphipolis, he invaded the land of the people who
were called independent Thracians,<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> keeping the city of
Philippi and mount Orbelus on the left. Crossing the
river Nessus,<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> they say he arrived at mount Haemus<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a>
on the tenth day. Here, along the defiles up the
ascent to the mountain, he was met by many of the
traders equipped with arms, as well as by the independent
Thracians, who had made preparations to
check the further advance of his expedition by seizing
the summit of the Haemus, along which was the route
for the passage of his army. They had collected their
waggons, and placed them in front of them, not only
using them as a rampart from which they might defend
themselves, in case they should be forced back, but also
intending to let them loose upon the phalanx of the
Macedonians, where the mountain was most precipitous, if
they tried to ascend. They had come to the conclusion<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a>
that the denser the phalanx was with which the waggons
rushing down came into collision, the more easily would
they scatter it by the violence of their fall upon it.</p>

<p>But Alexander formed a plan by which he might cross
the mountain with the least danger possible; and since
he was resolved to run all risks, knowing that there were
no means of passing elsewhere, he ordered the heavy-armed
soldiers, as soon as the waggons began to rush
down the declivity, to open their ranks, and directed
that those whom the road was sufficiently wide to permit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>to do so should stand apart, so that the waggons might
roll through the gap; but that those who were hemmed
in on all sides should either stoop down together or even
fall flat on the ground, and lock their shields compactly
together, so that the waggons rushing down upon them,
and in all probability by their very impetus leaping
over them, might pass on without injuring them. And
it turned out just as Alexander had conjectured and
exhorted. For some of the men made gaps in the
phalanx, and others locked their shields together. The
waggons rolled over the shields without doing much
injury, not a single man being killed under them. Then
the Macedonians regained their courage, inasmuch as
the waggons, which they had excessively dreaded, had
inflicted no damage upon them. With a loud cry they
assaulted the Thracians. Alexander ordered his archers
to march from the right wing in front of the rest of the
phalanx, because there the passage was easier, and to
shoot at the Thracians where they advanced. He himself
took his own guard, the shield-bearing infantry and
the Agrianians,<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> and led them to the left. Then the
archers shot at the Thracians who sallied forward, and
repulsed them; and the phalanx, coming to close fighting,
easily drove away from their position men who were
light-armed and badly equipped barbarians. The consequence
was, they no longer waited to receive Alexander
marching against them from the left, but casting away
their arms they fled down the mountain as each man
best could. About 1,500 of them were killed; but only
a few were taken prisoners on account of their swiftness
of foot and acquaintance with the country. However, all
the women who were accompanying them were captured,
as were also their children and all their booty.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Battle with the Triballians.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Alexander</span> sent the booty away southward to the cities
on the seashore,<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> entrusting to Lysanias and Philotas<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a>
the duty of setting it up for sale. But he himself crossed
the summit, and advancing through the Haemus into the
land of the Triballians, he arrived at the river Lyginus.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a>
This river is distant from the Ister<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> three days’ march
to one intending to go to the Haemus. Syrmus, king of
the Triballians, hearing of Alexander’s expedition long
before, had sent the women and children of the nation on
in advance to the Ister, ordering them to pass over into
one of the islands in that river, the name of which was
Peuce.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> To this island also the Thracians, whose territories
were conterminous with those of the Triballians,
had fled together for refuge at the approach of Alexander.
Syrmus himself likewise, accompanied by his train, had
fled for refuge to the same place. But the main body
of the Triballians fled back to the river, from which
Alexander had started the day before.</p>

<p>When he heard of their starting, he wheeled round
again, and, marching against them, surprised them just
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>as they were encamping. And those who were surprised
drew themselves up in battle array in a woody glen along
the bank of the river. Alexander drew out his phalanx
into a deep column, and led it on in person. He also
ordered the archers and slingers to run forward and
discharge arrows and stones at the barbarians, hoping to
provoke them by this to come out of the woody glen into
the ground unencumbered with trees. When they were
within reach of the missiles, and were struck by them,
they rushed out against the archers, who were undefended
by shields, with the purpose of fighting them hand-to-hand.
But when Alexander had drawn them thus out of
the woody glen, he ordered Philotas to take the cavalry
which came from upper Macedonia, and to charge their
right wing, where they had advanced furthest in their
sally. He also commanded Heraclides and Sopolis<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> to
lead on the cavalry which came from Bottiaea<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> and
Amphipolis against the left wing; while he himself
extended the phalanx of infantry and the rest of the
horse in front of the phalanx and led them against the
enemy’s centre. And indeed as long as there was only
skirmishing on both sides, the Triballians did not get the
worst of it; but as soon as the phalanx in dense array
attacked them with vigour, and the cavalry fell upon
them in various quarters, no longer merely striking them
with the javelin, but pushing them with their very horses,
then at length they turned and fled through the woody
glen to the river. Three thousand were slain in the flight;
few of them were taken prisoners, both because there was
a dense wood in front of the river, and the approach of
night deprived the Macedonians of certainty in their pursuit.
Ptolemy says, that of the Macedonians themselves
eleven horsemen and about forty foot soldiers were killed.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Alexander at the Danube and in the Country of the
Getae.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">On</span> the third day after the battle, Alexander reached the
river Ister, which is the largest of all the rivers in
Europe, traverses a very great tract of country, and
separates very warlike nations. Most of these belong to
the Celtic race,<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> in whose territory the sources of the
river take their rise. Of these nations the remotest are
the Quadi<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> and Marcomanni<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a>; then the Iazygianns,<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> a
branch of the Sauromatians<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a>; then the Getae,<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> who hold
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>the doctrine of immortality; then the main body of the
Sarmatians; and, lastly, the Scythians,<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> whose land
stretches as far as the outlets of the river, where through
five mouths it discharges its water into the Euxine Sea.<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a>
Here Alexander found some ships of war which had come
to him from Byzantium, through the Euxine Sea and up
the river. Filling these with archers and heavy-armed
troops, he sailed to the island to which the Triballians
and Thracians had fled for refuge. He tried to force a
landing; but the barbarians came to meet him at the
brink of the river, where the ships were making the
assault. But these were only few in number, and the
army in them small. The shores of the island, also, were
in most places too steep and precipitous for landing, and
the current of the river alongside it, being, as it were,
shut up into a narrow channel by the nearness of the
banks, was rapid and exceedingly difficult to stem.</p>

<p>Alexander therefore led back his ships, and determined
to cross the Ister and march against the Getae, who
dwelt on the other side of that river; for he observed that
many of them had collected on the bank of the river for
the purpose of barring his way, if he should cross. There
were of them about 4,000 cavalry and more than 10,000
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>infantry. At the same time a strong desire seized him
to advance beyond the Ister. He therefore went on board
the fleet himself. He also filled with hay the hides which
served them as tent-coverings, and collected from the
country around all the boats made from single trunks of
trees. Of these there was a great abundance, because the
people who dwell near the Ister use them for fishing in
the river, sometimes also for journeying to each other for
traffic up the river; and most of them carry on piracy
with them. Having collected as many of these as he
could, upon them he conveyed across as many of his
soldiers as was possible in such a fashion. Those who
crossed with Alexander amounted in number to 1,500
cavalry and 4,000 infantry.</p>

<hr />

<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Alexander Destroys the City of the Getae.&mdash;The
Ambassadors of the Celts.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">They</span> crossed over by night to a spot where the corn
stood high; and in this way they reached the bank more
secretly. At the approach of dawn Alexander led his
men through the field of standing corn, ordering the
infantry to lean upon the corn with their pikes<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> held
transversely, and thus to advance into the untilled ground.
As long as the phalanx was advancing through the standing
corn, the cavalry followed; but when they marched
out of the tilled land, Alexander himself led the horse
round to the right wing, and commanded Nicanor<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> to lead
the phalanx in a square. The Getae did not even sustain
the first charge of the cavalry; for Alexander’s audacity
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>seemed incredible to them, in having thus easily crossed
the Ister, the largest of rivers, in a single night, without
throwing a bridge over the stream. Terrible to them
also was the closely-locked order of the phalanx, and
violent the charge of the cavalry. At first they fled for
refuge into their city, which was distant about a parasang<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a>
from the Ister; but when they saw that Alexander was
leading his phalanx carefully along the river, to prevent
his infantry being anywhere surrounded by the Getae
lying in ambush; whereas he was leading his cavalry
straight on, they again abandoned the city, because it
was badly fortified. They carried off as many of their
women and children as their horses could carry, and
betook themselves into the steppes, in a direction which
led as far as possible from the river. Alexander took the
city and all the booty which the Getae left behind. This
he gave to Meleager<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> and Philip<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> to carry off. After
razing the city to the ground, he offered sacrifice upon
the bank of the river, to Zeus the preserver, to Heracles,<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a>
and to Ister himself, because he had allowed him to
cross; and while it was still day he brought all his men
back safe to the camp.</p>

<p>There ambassadors came to him from Syrmus, king of
the Triballians, and from the other independent nations
dwelling near the Ister. Some even arrived from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>Celts who dwelt near the Ionian gulf.<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> These people are
of great stature, and of a haughty disposition. All the
envoys said that they had come to seek Alexander’s
friendship. To all of them he gave pledges of amity, and
received pledges from them in return. He then asked
the Celts what thing in the world caused them special
alarm, expecting that his own great fame had reached
the Celts and had penetrated still further, and that they
would say that they feared him most of all things. But
the answer of the Celts turned out quite contrary to his
expectation; for, as they dwelt so far away from Alexander,
inhabiting districts difficult of access, and as they
saw he was about to set out in another direction, they
said they were afraid that the sky would some time or
other fall down upon them. These men also he sent
back, calling them friends, and ranking them as allies,
making the remark that the Celts were braggarts.<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Revolt of Clitus and Glaucias.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">He</span> then advanced into the land of the Agrianians and
Paeonians,<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> where messengers reached him, who reported
that Clitus, son of Bardylis,<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> had revolted, and that
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>Glaucias,<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> king of the Taulantians,<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> had gone over to
him. They also reported that the Autariatians<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> intended
to attack him on his way. He accordingly resolved to
commence his march without delay. But Langarus, king
of the Agrianians, who, in the lifetime of Philip, had been
an open and avowed friend of Alexander, and had gone
on an embassy to him in his private capacity, at that
time also came to him with the finest and best armed of
the shield-bearing troops, which he kept as a body-guard.
When this man heard that Alexander was inquiring who
the Autariatians were, and what was the number of their
men, he said that he need take no account of them,
since they were the least warlike of the tribes of that
district; and that he would himself make an inroad into
their land, so that they might have too much occupation
about their own affairs to attack others. Accordingly,
at Alexander’s order, he made an attack upon them; and
not only did he attack them, but he swept their land
clean of captives and booty. Thus the Autariatians were
indeed occupied with their own affairs. Langarus was
rewarded by Alexander with the greatest honours, and
received from him the gifts which were considered most
valuable in the eyes of the king of the Macedonians.
Alexander also promised to give him his sister Cyna<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> in
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>marriage when he arrived at Pella.<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> But Langarus fell
ill and died on his return home.</p>

<p>After this, Alexander marched along the river Erigon,<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a>
and proceeded to the city of Pelium;<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> for Clitus had
seized this city, as it was the strongest in the country.
When Alexander arrived at this place, and had encamped
near the river Eordaicus,<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> he resolved to make an assault
upon the wall the next day. But Clitus held the mountains
which encircled the city, and commanded it from
their height; moreover, they were covered with dense
thickets. His intention was to fall upon the Macedonians
from all sides, if they assaulted the city. But Glaucias,
king of the Taulantians, had not yet joined him.
Alexander, however, led his forces towards the city; and
the enemy, after sacrificing three boys, an equal number
of girls, and three black rams, sallied forth for the
purpose of receiving the Macedonians in a hand-to-hand
conflict. But as soon as they came to close quarters,
they left the positions which they had occupied, strong
as they were,<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> in such haste that even their sacrificial
victims were captured still lying on the ground.</p>

<p>On this day he shut them up in the city, and encamping
near the wall, he resolved to intercept them by a
circumvallation; but on the next day Glaucias, king of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>the Taulantians, arrived with a great force. Then, indeed,
Alexander gave up the hope of capturing the city with
his present force, since many warlike troops had fled for
refuge into it, and Glaucias with his large army would be
likely to follow him up closely if he assailed the wall.
But he sent Philotas on a foraging expedition, with the
beasts of burden from the camp and a sufficient body of
cavalry to serve as a guard. When Glaucias heard of
the expedition of Philotas he marched out to meet him,
and seized the mountains which surrounded the plain,
from which Philotas intended to procure forage. As
soon as Alexander was informed that his cavalry and
beasts of burden would be in danger if night overtook
them, taking the shield-bearing troops,<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> the archers, the
Agrianians, and about four hundred cavalry, he went
with all speed to their aid. The rest of the army he left
behind near the city, to prevent the citizens from hastening
forth to form a junction with Glaucias (as they would
have done), if all the Macedonian army had withdrawn.
Directly Glaucias perceived that Alexander was advancing,
he evacuated the mountains, and Philotas and his
forces returned to the camp in safety. But Clitus and
Glaucias still imagined that they had caught Alexander
in a disadvantageous position; for they were occupying
the mountains, which commanded the plain by their
height, with a large body of cavalry, javelin-throwers,
and slingers, besides a considerable number of heavy-armed
infantry. Moreover, the men who had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>beleaguered in the city were expected to pursue the Macedonians
closely if they made a retreat. The ground also
through which Alexander had to march was evidently
narrow and covered with wood; on one side it was
hemmed in by a river, and on the other there was a very
lofty and craggy mountain, so that there would not be
room for the army to pass, even if only four shield-bearers
marched abreast.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Defeat of Clitus and Glaucias.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Then</span> Alexander drew up his army in such a way that
the depth of the phalanx was 120 men; and stationing
200 cavalry on each wing, he ordered them to preserve
silence, in order to receive the word of command quickly.
Accordingly he gave the signal to the heavy-armed
infantry in the first place to hold their spears erect, and
then to couch them at the concerted sign; at one time
to incline their spears to the right, closely locked
together, and at another time towards the left. He then
set the phalanx itself into quick motion forward, and
marched it towards the wings, now to the right, and then
to the left. After thus arranging and re-arranging his
army many times very rapidly, he at last formed his
phalanx into a sort of wedge, and led it towards the left
against the enemy, who had long been in a state of
amazement at seeing both the order and the rapidity
of his evolutions. Consequently they did not sustain
Alexander’s attack, but quitted the first ridges of the
mountain. Upon this, Alexander ordered the Macedonians
to raise the battle cry and make a clatter with
their spears upon their shields; and the Taulantians,
being still more alarmed at the noise, led their army
back to the city with all speed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span></p>

<p>As Alexander saw only a few of the enemy still occupying
a ridge, along which lay his route, he ordered
his body-guards and personal companions to take their
shields, mount their horses, and ride to the hill; and
when they reached it, if those who had occupied the
position awaited them, he said that half of them were to
leap from their horses, and to fight as foot-soldiers, being
mingled with the cavalry. But when the enemy saw
Alexander’s advance, they quitted the hill and retreated
to the mountains in both directions. Then Alexander,
with his companions,<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> seized the hill, and sent for the
Agrianians and archers, who numbered 2,000. He also
ordered the shield-bearing guards to cross the river, and
after them the regiments of Macedonian infantry, with
instructions that, as soon as they had succeeded in crossing,
they should draw out in rank towards the left, so
that the phalanx of men crossing might appear compact
at once. He himself, in the vanguard, was all the
time observing from the ridge the enemy’s advance.
They, seeing the force crossing the river, marched down
the mountains to meet them, with the purpose of attacking
Alexander’s rear in its retreat. But, as they were
just drawing near, Alexander rushed forth with his own
division, and the phalanx raised the battle-cry, as if
about to advance through the river. When the enemy
saw all the Macedonians marching against them, they
turned and fled. Upon this, Alexander led the Agrianians
and archers at full speed towards the river, and succeeded
in being himself the first man to cross it. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>when he saw the enemy pressing upon the men in the
rear, he stationed his engines of war upon the bank, and
ordered the engineers to shoot from them as far forward
as possible all sorts of projectiles which are usually shot
from military engines.<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> He directed the archers, who
had also entered the water, to shoot their arrows from the
middle of the river. But Glaucias durst not advance
within range of the missiles; so that the Macedonians
passed over in such safety, that not one of them lost his
life in the retreat.</p>

<p>Three days after this, Alexander discovered that Clitus
and Glaucias lay carelessly encamped; that neither were
their sentinels on guard in military order, nor had they
protected themselves with a rampart or ditch, as if they
imagined he had withdrawn through fear; and that
they had extended their line to a disadvantageous length.
He therefore crossed the river again secretly, at the
approach of night, leading with him the shield-bearing
guards, the Agrianians, the archers, and the brigades of
Perdiccas<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> and Coenus,<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> after having given orders for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>rest of the army to follow. As soon as he saw a favourable
opportunity for the attack, without waiting for all to
be present, he despatched the archers and Agrianians
against the foe. These, being arranged in phalanx, fell
unawares with the most furious charge upon their flank,
where they were likely to come into conflict with their
weakest point, and slew some of them still in their beds,
others being easily caught in their flight. Accordingly,
many were there captured and killed, as were many also
in the disorderly and panic-stricken retreat which ensued.
Not a few, moreover, were taken prisoners. Alexander
kept up the pursuit as far as the Taulantian mountains;
and as many of them as escaped, preserved their lives by
throwing away their arms. Clitus first fled for refuge
into the city, which, however, he set on fire, and withdrew
to Glaucias, in the land of the Taulantians.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Revolt of Thebes</span> (<i>September</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C. 335</span>).</p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">While</span> these events were occurring, some of the exiles
who had been banished from Thebes, coming to the city
by night, and being brought in by some of the citizens,
in order to effect a change in the government, apprehended
and slew outside the Cadmea,<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a> Amyntas and
Timolaüs,<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> two of the men who held that fortress, having
no suspicion that any hostile attempt was about to be
made. Then entering the public assembly, they incited
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>the Thebans to revolt from Alexander, holding out to
them as pretexts the ancient and glorious words, liberty
and freedom of speech, and urging them now at last to
rid themselves of the heavy yoke of the Macedonians.
By stoutly maintaining that Alexander had been killed
in Illyria they gained more power in persuading the
multitude;<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> for this report was prevalent, and for many
reasons it gained credit, both because he had been
absent a long time, and because no news had arrived
from him. Accordingly, as is usual in such cases, not
knowing the facts, each man conjectured what was most
pleasing to himself.</p>

<p>When Alexander heard what was being done at
Thebes, he thought it was a movement not at all to
be slighted, inasmuch as he had for a long time suspected
the city of Athens and deemed the audacious
action of the Thebans no trivial matter, if the Lacedaemonians,
who had long been disaffected in their feelings
to him, and the Aetolians and certain other States in the
Peloponnese, who were not firm in their allegiance to
him, should take part with the Thebans in their revolutionary
effort. He therefore led his army through
Eordaea and Elimiotis<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a> and along the peaks of Stymphaea
and Paravaea,<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> and on the seventh day arrived at Pelina<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a>
in Thessaly. Starting thence, he entered Boeotia on the
sixth day; so that the Thebans did not learn that he
had passed south of Thermopylae, until he was at
Onchestus<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a> with the whole of his army. Even then
the authors of the revolt asserted that Antipater’s army
had arrived out of Macedonia, stoutly affirming that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
Alexander himself was dead, and being very angry with
those who announced that it was Alexander himself who
was advancing.<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> For they said it must be another
Alexander, the son of Aëropus, who was coming.<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a> On
the following day Alexander set out from Onchestus, and
advanced towards the city along the territory consecrated
to Iolaüs;<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> where indeed he encamped, in order
to give the Thebans further time to repent of their evil
resolutions and to send an embassy to him. But so far
were they from showing any sign of wishing to come
to an accommodation, that their cavalry and a large body
of light-armed infantry sallied forth from the city as
far as the camp, and, skirmishing with the Macedonian
outposts, slew a few of their men. Alexander hereupon
sent forth a party of his light-armed infantry and
archers to repel their sortie; and these men repelled
them with ease, just as they were approaching the very
camp. The next day he took the whole of his army and
marched round towards the gate which led to Eleutherae
and Attica. But not even then did he assault the wall
itself, but encamped not far away from the Cadmea, in
order that succour might be at hand to the Macedonians
who were occupying that citadel. For the Thebans had
blockaded the Cadmea with a double stockade and were
guarding it, so that no one from without might be able
to give succour to those who were beleaguered, and that
the garrison might not be able, by making a sally, to do
them any injury, when they were attacking the enemy
outside. But Alexander remained encamped near the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
Cadmea, for he still wished rather to come to friendly
terms with the Thebans than to come to a contest with
them.<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a> Then those of the Thebans who knew what was
for the best interest of the commonwealth were eager
to go out to Alexander and obtain pardon for the commonalty
of Thebes for their revolt; but the exiles and
those who had summoned them home kept on inciting
the populace to war by every means in their power, since
they despaired of obtaining for themselves any indulgence
from Alexander, especially as some of them were
also Boeotarchs.<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> However not even for this did Alexander
assault the city.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fall of Thebes.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">But</span> Ptolemy, son of Lagus, tells us that Perdiccas, who
had been posted in the advanced guard of the camp
with his own brigade, and was not far from the enemy’s
stockade, did not wait for the signal from Alexander to
commence the battle; but of his own accord was the
first to assault the stockade, and, having made a breach
in it, fell upon the advanced guard of the Thebans.<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a>
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>Amyntas,<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a> son of Andromenes, followed Perdiccas, because
he had been stationed with him. This general
also of his own accord led on his brigade when he saw
that Perdiccas had advanced within the stockade. When
Alexander saw this, he led on the rest of his army,
fearing that unsupported they might be intercepted by
the Thebans and be in danger of destruction. He gave
instructions to the archers and Agrianians to rush within
the stockade, but he still retained the guards and shield-bearing
troops outside. Then indeed Perdiccas, after
forcing his way within the second stockade, fell there
wounded with a dart, and was carried back grievously
injured to the camp, where he was with difficulty cured
of his wound. However the men of Perdiccas, in company
with the archers sent by Alexander, fell upon the
Thebans and shut them up in the hollow way leading
to the temple of Heracles, and followed them in their
retreat as far as the temple itself. The Thebans, having
wheeled round, again advanced from that position with
a shout, and put the Macedonians to flight. Eurybotas
the Cretan, the captain of the archers, fell with about
seventy of his men; but the rest fled to the Macedonian
guard and the royal shield-bearing troops. Now, when
Alexander saw that his own men were in flight, and
that the Thebans had broken their ranks in pursuit, he
attacked them with his phalanx drawn up in proper
order, and drove them back within the gates. The
Thebans fled in such a panic that being driven into the
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>city through the gates they had not time to shut them;
for the Macedonians, who were close behind the fugitives,
rushed with them within the fortifications, inasmuch as
the walls were destitute of defenders on account of the
numerous pickets in front of them. When the Macedonians
had entered the Cadmea, some of them marched
out of it, in company with those who held the fortress,
into the other part of the city opposite the temple of
Amphion,<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a> but others crossing along the walls, which
were now in the possession of those who had rushed in
together with the fugitives, advanced with a run into
the market-place. Those of the Thebans who had been
drawn up opposite the temple of Amphion stood their
ground for a short time; but when the Macedonians
under the command of Alexander were seen to be pressing
hard upon them in various directions, their cavalry
rushed through the city and sallied forth into the plain,
and their infantry fled for safety as each man found it
possible. Then indeed the Thebans, no longer defending
themselves, were slain, not so much by the Macedonians
as by the Phocians, Plataeans and other
Boeotians,<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a> who by indiscriminate slaughter vented their
rage against them. Some were even attacked in the
houses, having there turned to defend themselves from
the enemy, and others were slain as they were supplicating
the protection of the gods in the temples; not
even the women and children being spared.<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Destruction of Thebes.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">This</span> was felt by the Greeks to be a general calamity
for it struck the rest of the Greeks with no less consternation
than it did those who had themselves taken
part in the struggle, both on account of the magnitude of
the captured city and the celerity of the action, the
result of which was in the highest degree contrary to
the expectation both of the sufferers and the perpetrators.
For the disasters which befell the Athenians in relation
to Sicily,<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a> though in regard to the number of those who
perished they brought no less misfortune to the city,
yet, because their army was destroyed far away from
their own land, being composed for the most part rather
of auxiliary troops than of native Athenians, and because
their city itself was left to them intact, so that afterwards
they held their own in war even for a long time, though
fighting against the Lacedaemonians and their allies, as
well as the Great King; these disasters, I say, neither
produced in the persons who were themselves involved
in the calamity an equal sensation of the misfortune, nor
did they cause the other Greeks a similar consternation
at the catastrophe. Again, the defeat sustained by the
Athenians at Aegospotami<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a> was a naval one, and the
city received no other humiliation than the demolition
of the Long Walls, the surrender of most of her ships,
and the loss of supremacy. However, they still retained
their hereditary form of government, and not long after
recovered their former power to such a degree as not
only to build up the Long Walls but to recover the rule
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>of the sea<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a> and in their turn to preserve from extreme
danger those very Lacedaemonians then so formidable to
them, who had come and almost obliterated their city.
Moreover, the defeat of the Lacedaemonians at Leuctra
and Mantinea filled them with consternation rather by
the unexpectedness of the disaster than because of the
number of those who perished.<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a> And the attack made
by the Boeotians and Arcadians under Epaminondas
upon the city of Sparta, even this terrified both the
Lacedaemonians themselves and those who participated
with them in the transactions at that time,<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a> rather by the
novelty of the sight than by the reality of the danger.
The capture of the city of the Plataeans was not a great
calamity, by reason of the small number of those who
were taken in it; most of the citizens having long before
escaped to Athens.<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> Again, the capture of Melus and
Scione simply related to insular States, and rather
brought disgrace to those who perpetrated the outrages
than produced great surprise among the Grecian community
as<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> a whole.</p>

<p>But the Thebans having effected their revolt suddenly
and without any previous consideration, the capture
of the city being brought about in so short a time and
without difficulty on the part of the captors, the slaughter,
being great, as was natural, from its being made by
men of the same race who were glutting their revenge
on them for ancient injuries, the complete enslavement
of a city which excelled among those in Greece at that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>time both in power and warlike reputation, all this was
attributed not without probability to the avenging wrath
of the deity. It seemed as if the Thebans had after a
long time suffered this punishment for their betrayal of
the Greeks in the Median war,<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> for their seizure of the
city of Plataeae during the truce, and for their complete
enslavement of it, as well as for the un-Hellenic slaughter
of the men who had surrendered to the Lacedaemonians,
which had been committed at the instigation of the
Thebans; and for the devastation of the territory in
which the Greeks had stood in battle-array against the
Medes and had repelled danger from Greece; lastly,
because by their vote they had tried to ruin the Athenians
when a motion was brought forward among the allies
of the Lacedaemonians for the enslavement of Athens.<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a>
Moreover it was reported that before the disaster many
portents were sent from the deity, which indeed at the
time were treated with neglect, but afterwards when
men called them to remembrance they were compelled to
consider that the events which occurred had been long
before prognosticated.<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a></p>

<p>The settlement of Theban affairs was entrusted by
Alexander to the allies who had taken part in the action.
They resolved to occupy the Cadmea with a garrison;
to raze the city to the ground; to distribute among
themselves all the territory, except what was dedicated
to the gods; and to sell into slavery the women and
children, and as many of the males as survived, except
those who were priests or priestesses, and those who
were bound to Philip or Alexander by the ties of hospitality
or had been public agents of the Macedonians. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>is said that Alexander preserved the house and the
descendants of Pindar the poet, out of respect for his
memory.<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a> In addition to these things, the allies decreed
that Orchomenus<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a> and Plataeae should be rebuilt
and fortified.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER X.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Alexander’s Dealings with Athens.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">As</span> soon as news of the calamity which had befallen the
Thebans reached the other Greeks, the Arcadians, who
had set out from their own land for the purpose of
giving aid to the Thebans, passed sentence of death
on those who had instigated them to render aid. The
Eleans also received back their exiles from banishment,
because they were Alexander’s adherents; and the
Aetolians, each tribe for itself, sent embassies to him,
begging to receive pardon, because they also had attempted
to effect a revolution, on the receipt of the report
which had been spread by the Thebans. The Athenians
also, who, at the time when some of the Thebans, escaping
from the carnage, arrived at Athens, were engaged
in celebrating the Great Mysteries,<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a> abandoned the sacred
rites in great consternation, and carried their goods
and chattels from the rural districts into the city. The
people came together in public assembly, and, on the
motion of Demades, elected from all the citizens ten
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>ambassadors, men whom they knew to be Alexander’s
special adherents, and sent them to signify to him,
though somewhat unseasonably, that the Athenian people
rejoiced at his safe return from the land of the
Illyrians and Triballians, and at the punishment which
he had inflicted upon the Thebans for their rebellion.
In regard to other matters he gave the embassy a
courteous reply, but wrote a letter to the people demanding
the surrender of Demosthenes and Lycurgus,
as well as that of Hyperides, Polyeuctus, Chares, Charidemus,
Ephialtes, Diotimus, and Moerocles;<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a> alleging
that these men were the cause of the disaster which
befell the city at Chaeronea, and the authors of the subsequent
offensive proceedings after Philip’s death, both
against himself and his father.<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a> He also declared that
they had instigated the Thebans to revolt no less than
had those of the Thebans themselves who favoured a
revolution. The Athenians, however, did not surrender
the men, but sent another embassy to Alexander,<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a> entreating
him to remit his wrath against the persons
whom he had demanded. The king did remit his wrath
against them, either out of respect for the city of Athens,
or from an earnest desire to start on the expedition into
Asia, not wishing to leave behind him among the Greeks
any cause for distrust. However, he ordered Charidemus
alone of the men whom he had demanded as prisoners
and who had not been given up, to go into banishment.
Charidemus therefore went as an exile to King Darius
in Asia.<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XI.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Alexander Crosses the Hellespont and Visits Troy.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Having</span> settled these affairs, he returned into Macedonia.
He then offered to the Olympian Zeus the sacrifice which
had been instituted by Archelaüs,<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a> and had been customary
up to that time; and he celebrated the public
contest of the Olympic games at Aegae.<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a> It is said that
he also held a public contest in honour of the Muses.
At this time it was reported that the statue of Orpheus,
son of Oeagrus the Thracian, which was in Pieris,<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a>
sweated incessantly.<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a> Various were the explanations of
this prodigy given by the soothsayers; but Aristander,<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a>
a man of Telmissus, a soothsayer, bade Alexander take
courage; for he said it was evident from this that there
would be much labour for the epic and lyric poets, and
for the writers of odes, to compose and sing about
Alexander and his achievements.</p>

<p>(<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 334.) At the beginning of the spring he marched
towards the Hellespont, entrusting the affairs of Macedonia
and Greece to Antipater. He led not much above
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>30,000 infantry together with light-armed troops and
archers, and more than 5,000 cavalry.<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a> His march was
past the lake Cercinitis,<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a> towards Amphipolis and the
mouths of the river Strymon. Having crossed this river
he passed by the Pangaean mountain,<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a> along the road
leading to Abdera and Maronea, Grecian cities built on
the coast. Thence he arrived at the river Hebrus,<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a> and
easily crossed it. Thence he proceeded through Paetica
to the river Melas, having crossed which he arrived at
Sestus, in twenty days altogether from the time of his
starting from home. When he came to Elaeūs he
offered sacrifice to Protesilaus upon the tomb of that
hero, both for other reasons and because Protesilaus
seemed to have been the first of the Greeks who took
part with Agamemnon in the expedition to Ilium to
disembark in Asia. The design of this sacrifice was, that
his disembarking in Asia might be more fortunate than
that of Protesilaus had been.<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a> He then committed to Parmenio
the duty of conveying the cavalry and the greater
part of the infantry from Sestus to Abydus; and they
were transported in 160 triremes, besides many trading
vessels.<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a> The prevailing account is, that Alexander
started from Elaeūs and put into the Port of Achaeans,<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a>
that with his own hand he steered the general’s ship
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>across, and that when he was about the middle of the
channel of the Hellespont he sacrificed a bull to Poseidon
and the Nereids, and poured forth a libation to them into
the sea from a golden goblet. They say also that he was
the first man to step out of the ship in full armour on the
land of Asia,<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a> and that he erected altars to Zeus, the
protector of people landing, to Athena, and to Heracles,
at the place in Europe whence he started, and at the
place in Asia where he disembarked. It is also said that
he went up to Ilium and offered sacrifice to the Trojan
Athena; that he set up his own panoply in the temple
as a votive offering, and in exchange for it took away
some of the consecrated arms which had been preserved
from the time of the Trojan war. These arms were said
to have been carried in front of him into the battles by
the shield-bearing guards. A report also prevails that
he offered sacrifice to Priam upon the altar of Zeus the
household god, deprecating the wrath of Priam against
the progeny of Neoptolemus, from whom Alexander
himself derived his origin.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XII.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Alexander at the Tomb of Achilles</span>.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Memnon’s
Advice Rejected by the Persian Generals.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">When</span> he went up to Ilium, Menoetius the pilot crowned
him with a golden crown; after him Chares the Athenian,<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a>
coming from Sigeum, as well as certain others, both
Greeks and natives, did the same. Alexander then
encircled the tomb of Achilles with a garland; and it is
said that Hephaestion<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a> decorated that of Patroclus in the
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>same way. There is indeed a report that Alexander
pronounced Achilles fortunate in getting Homer as the
herald of his fame to posterity.<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a> And in truth it was
meet that Alexander should deem Achilles fortunate for
this reason especially; for to Alexander himself this
privilege was wanting, a thing which was not in accordance
with the rest of his good fortune. His achievements
have, therefore, not been related to mankind in
a manner worthy of the hero. Neither in prose nor in
verse has any one suitably honoured him; nor has he
ever been sung of in a lyric poem, in which style of
poetry Hiero, Gelo, Thero, and many others not at all
comparable with Alexander, have been praised.<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a> Consequently
Alexander’s deeds are far less known than the
meanest achievements of antiquity. For instance, the
march of the ten thousand with Cyrus up to Persia
against King Artaxerxes, the tragic fate of Clearchus and
those who were captured along with him,<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a> and the march
of the same men down to the sea, in which they were led
by Xenophon, are events much better known to men
through Xenophon’s narrative than are Alexander and
his achievements. And yet Alexander neither accompanied
another man’s expedition, nor did he in flight
from the Great King overcome those who obstructed his
march down to the sea. And, indeed, there is no other
single individual among Greeks or barbarians who
achieved exploits so great or important either in regard
to number or magnitude as he did. This was the reason
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>which induced me to undertake this history, not thinking
myself incompetent to make Alexander’s deeds known
to men. For whoever I may be, this I know about
myself, that there is no need for me to assert my name,
for it is not unknown to men; nor is it needful for me to
say what my native land and family are, or if I have held
any public office in my own country. But this I do
assert, that this historical work is and has been from my
youth up, in place of native land, family, and public
offices to me; and for this reason I do not deem myself
unworthy to rank among the first authors in the Greek
language, if Alexander indeed is among the first in
arms.</p>

<p>From Ilium Alexander came to Arisbe, where his
entire force had encamped after crossing the Hellespont;
and on the following day he came to Percote. On
the next, passing by Lampsacus, he encamped near the
river Practius, which flows from the Idaean mountains
and discharges itself into the sea between the Hellespont
and the Euxine Sea. Thence passing by the city of
Colonae, he arrived at Hermotus. He now sent scouts
before the army under the command of Amyntas, son
of Arrhabaeus, who had the squadron of the Companion
cavalry which came from Apollonia,<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a> under the captain
Socrates, son of Sathon, and four squadrons of what were
called Prodromi (runners forward). In the march he
despatched Panegorus, son of Lycagoras, one of the
Companions, to take possession of the city of Priapus,
which was surrendered by the inhabitants.</p>

<p>The Persian generals were Arsames, Rheomithres,
Petines, Niphates, and with them Spithridates, viceroy
of Lydia and Ionia, and Arsites, governor of the Phrygia
near the Hellespont. These had encamped near the city
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>of Zeleia with the Persian cavalry and the Grecian mercenaries.
When they were holding a council about the
state of affairs, it was reported to them that Alexander
had crossed (the Hellespont). Memnon, the Rhodian,<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a>
advised them not to risk a conflict with the Macedonians,
since they were far superior to them in infantry, and
Alexander was there in person; whereas Darius was not
with them. He advised them to advance and destroy the
fodder, by trampling it down under their horses’ hoofs, to
burn the crops of the country, and not even to spare the
very cities. “For then Alexander,” said he, “will not be
able to stay in the land from lack of provisions.”<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a> It is
said that in the Persian conference Arsites asserted that
he would not allow a single house belonging to the people
placed under his rule to be burned, and that the other
Persians agreed with Arsites, because they had a suspicion
that Memnon was deliberately contriving to protract
the war for the purpose of obtaining honour from
the king.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER XIII.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Battle of the Granicus</span> (<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 334).</p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Meantime</span> Alexander was advancing to the river Granicus,<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a>
with his army arranged for battle, having drawn up his
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>heavy-armed troops in a double phalanx, leading the
cavalry on the wings, and having ordered that the
baggage should follow in the rear. And Hegelochus at
the head of the cavalry, who were armed with the long
pike,<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a> and about 500 of the light-armed troops, was sent
by him to reconnoitre the proceedings of the enemy.
When Alexander was not far from the river Granicus,
some of his scouts rode up to him at full speed and
announced that the Persians had taken up their position
on the other side of the Granicus, drawn up ready for
battle. Thereupon Alexander arranged all his army with
the intention of fighting. Then Parmenio approached
him and spoke as follows: “I think, O king, that it
is advisable for the present to pitch our camp on the
bank of the river as we are. For I think that the enemy,
being, as they are, much inferior to us in infantry, will
not dare to pass the night near us, and therefore they
will permit the army to cross the ford with ease at daybreak.
For we shall then pass over before they can put themselves
in order of battle;<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a> whereas, I do not think
that we can now attempt the operation without evident
risk, because it is not possible to lead the army through
the river with its front extended. Besides, it is clear
that many parts of the stream are deep, and you see that
these banks are steep and in some places abrupt. Therefore
the enemy’s cavalry, being formed into a dense
square, will attack us as we emerge from the water in
broken ranks and in column, in the place where we are
weakest. At the present juncture the first repulse would
be difficult to retrieve, as well as perilous for the issue of
the whole war.”</p>

<p>But to this Alexander replied: “I recognise the force
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>of these arguments, O Parmenio; but I should feel it a
disgrace, if, after crossing the Hellespont so easily, this
brook (for with such an appellation he made light of
the Granicus) should bar our passage for a moment. I
consider that this would be in accordance neither with
the fame of the Macedonians nor with my own eagerness
for encountering danger. Moreover, I think that the
Persians will regain courage, as being a match in war
for Macedonians, since up to the present time they have
suffered no defeat from me to warrant the fear they
entertain.”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIV.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Arrangement of the Hostile Armies.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Having</span> spoken thus, he sent Parmenio to command upon
the left wing, while he led in person on the right. And
at the head of the right wing he placed the following
officers:&mdash;Philotas, son of Parmenio, with the cavalry
Companions, the archers, and the Agrianian javelin-men;
and Amyntas, son of Arrhabaeus, with the cavalry carrying
the long pike, the Paeonians, and the squadron of
Socrates, was posted near Philotas. Close to these were
posted the Companions who were shield-bearing infantry
under the command of Nicanor, son of Parmenio. Next
to these the brigade of Perdiccas, son of Orontes, then
that of Coenus, son of Polemocrates; then that of Craterus,<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a>
son of Alexander, and that of Amyntas, son of Andromenes;
finally, the men commanded by Philip, son of
Amyntas. The first on the left wing were the Thes<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>salian
cavalry, commanded by Calas, son of Harpalus;<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a>
next to these, the cavalry of the Grecian allies, commanded
by Philip, son of Menelaüs;<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a> next to these the
Thracians, commanded by Agatho.<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a> Close to these were
the infantry, the brigades of Craterus, Meleager, and
Philip, reaching as far as the centre of the entire line.</p>

<p>The Persian cavalry were about 20,000 in number, and
their infantry, consisting of Grecian mercenaries, fell a
little short of the same number.<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a> They had extended
their horse along the bank of the river in a long phalanx,
and had posted the infantry behind the cavalry, for the
ground above the bank was steep and commanding.
They also marshalled dense squadrons of cavalry upon
that part of the bank where they observed Alexander
himself advancing against their left wing; for he was
conspicuous both by the brightness of his arms and by
the respectful service of his attendants. Both armies
stood a long time at the margin of the river, keeping
quiet from dread of the result; and profound silence
was observed on both sides. For the Persians were
waiting till the Macedonians should step into the water,
with the intention of attacking them as they emerged.
Alexander leaped upon his steed, ordering those about
him to follow, and exhorting them to show themselves
valiant men. He then commanded Amyntas, son of
Arrhabaeus, to make the first rush into the river at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>head of the skirmishing cavalry, the Paeonians, and one
regiment of infantry; and in front of these he had placed
Ptolemy, son of Philip, in command of the squadron of
Socrates, which body of men indeed on that day happened
to have the lead of all the cavalry force. He himself
led the right wing with sounding of trumpets, and
the men raising the war-cry to Enyalius.<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a> He entered
the ford, keeping his line always extended obliquely in
the direction in which the stream flowed, in order that
the Persians might not fall upon him on the flank as he
was emerging from the water, but that he might, as far
as practicable,<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a> encounter them with his phalanx.</p>

<hr />

<h3>CHAPTER XV.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Description of the Battle of the Granicus.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">The</span> Persians began the contest by hurling missiles from
above in the direction where the men of Amyntas and
Socrates were the first to reach the bank; some of them
casting javelins into the river from their commanding
position on the bank, and others stepping down along
the flatter parts of it to the very edge of the water.
Then ensued a violent struggle on the part of the cavalry,
on the one side to emerge from the river, and on the
other to prevent the landing. From the Persians there
was a terrible discharge of darts; but the Macedonians
fought with spears. The Macedonians, being far inferior
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>in number, suffered severely at the first onset, because they
were obliged to defend themselves in the river, where
their footing was unsteady, and where they were below
the level of their assailants; whereas the Persians were
fighting from the top of the bank, which gave them an
advantage, especially as the best of the Persian horse had
been posted there. Memnon himself, as well as his sons,
were running every risk with these; and the Macedonians
who first came into conflict with the Persians, though
they showed great valour, were cut down, except those
who retreated to Alexander, who was now approaching.
For the king was already near, leading with him the
right wing. He made his first assault upon the Persians
at the place where the whole mass of their horse and
the leaders themselves were posted; and around him a
desperate conflict raged,<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a> during which one rank of the
Macedonians after another easily kept on crossing the
river. Though they fought on horseback, it seemed
more like an infantry than a cavalry battle; for they
struggled for the mastery, horses being jammed with
horses and men with men, the Macedonians striving to
drive the Persians entirely away from the bank and
to force them into the plain, and the Persians striving to
obstruct their landing and to push them back again into
the river. At last Alexander’s men began to gain the
advantage, both through their superior strength and
military discipline, and because they fought with spear-shafts
made of cornel-wood, whereas the Persians used
only darts.</p>

<p>Then indeed, Alexander’s spear being broken to shivers
in the conflict, he asked Aretis, one of the royal guards,
whose duty it was to assist the king to mount his horse,
for another spear. But this man’s spear had also been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>shivered whilst he was in the thickest of the struggle, and
he was conspicuous fighting with the half of his broken
spear. Showing this to Alexander, he bade him ask
some one else for one. Then Demaratus, a man of
Corinth, one of his personal Companions, gave him his
own spear; which he had no sooner taken than seeing
Mithridates, the son-in-law of Darius, riding far in front
of the others, and leading with him a body of cavalry
arranged like a wedge, he rode on in front of the others,
and hitting at the face of Mithridates with his spear,
struck him to the ground. But hereupon, Rhoesaces
rode up to Alexander and hit him on the head with his
scimitar, breaking off a piece of his helmet. But the
helmet broke the force of the blow. This man also
Alexander struck to the ground, hitting him in the
chest through the breastplate with his lance. And now
Spithridates from behind had already raised aloft his
scimitar against the king, when Clitus, son of Dropidas,
anticipated his blow, and hitting him on the arm, cut it
off, scimitar and all.<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a> Meantime the horsemen, as many
as were able, kept on securing a landing all down the
river, and were joining Alexander’s forces.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVI.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Defeat of the Persians.&mdash;Loss on Both Sides.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">The</span> Persians themselves, as well as their horses, were
now being struck on their faces with the lances from
all sides, and were being repulsed by the cavalry. They
also received much damage from the light-armed troops
who were mingled with the cavalry. They first began
to give way where Alexander himself was braving danger
in the front. When their centre had given way, the
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>horse on both wings were also naturally broken through,
and took to speedy flight. Of the Persian cavalry only
about 1,000 were killed; for Alexander did not pursue
them far, but turned aside to attack the Greek mercenaries,
the main body of whom was still remaining where
it was posted at first. This they did rather from amazement
at the unexpected result of the struggle than from
any steady resolution. Leading the phalanx against
these, and ordering the cavalry to fall upon them from
all sides in the midst, he soon cut them up, so that none
of them escaped except such as might have concealed
themselves among the dead bodies. About 2,000 were
taken prisoners.<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a> The following leaders of the Persians
also fell in the battle: Niphates, Petines, Spithridates,
viceroy of Lydia, Mithrobuzanes, governor of Cappadocia,
Mithridates, the son-in-law of Darius, Arbupales,
son of Darius the son of Artaxerxes, Pharnaces, brother
of the wife of Darius,<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a> and Onares, commander of the
auxiliaries. Arsites fled from the battle into Phrygia,
where he is reported to have committed suicide, because
he was deemed by the Persians the cause of their defeat
on that occasion.</p>

<p>Of the Macedonians, about twenty-five of the Companions
were killed at the first onset; brazen statues of
whom were erected at Dium,<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a> executed by Lysippus,<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a> at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>Alexander’s order. The same statuary also executed a
statue of Alexander himself, being chosen by him for
the work in preference to all other artists. Of the other
cavalry over sixty were slain, and of the infantry, about
thirty.<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a> These were buried by Alexander the next day,
together with their arms and other decorations. To
their parents and children he granted exemption from
imposts on agricultural produce, and he relieved them
from all personal services and taxes upon property. He
also exhibited great solicitude in regard to the wounded,
for he himself visited each man, looked at their wounds,
and inquired how and in the performance of what duty
they had received them, allowing them both to speak and
brag of their own deeds. He also buried the Persian
commanders and the Greek mercenaries who were killed
fighting on the side of the enemy. But as many of them
as he took prisoners he bound in fetters and sent them
away to Macedonia to till the soil, because, though they
were Greeks, they were fighting against Greece on behalf
of the foreigners in opposition to the decrees which the
Greeks had made in their federal council.<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a> To Athens
also he sent 300 suits of Persian armour to be hung up
in the Acropolis<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a> as a votive offering to Athena, and
ordered this inscription to be fixed over them: “Alexander,
son of Philip, and all the Greeks except the
Lacedaemonians, present this offering from the spoils
taken from the foreigners inhabiting Asia.”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVII.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Alexander in Sardis and Ephesus.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Having</span> appointed Calas to the post of viceroy of the
territory which had been under the rule of Arsites, and
having commanded the inhabitants to pay to him the
same tribute which they had paid to Darius, he ordered
as many of the natives as came down from the mountains
and surrendered to him to depart to their several abodes.
He also acquitted the people of Zeleia<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a> of blame, because
he knew they had been compelled to assist the Persians
in the war. He then despatched Parmenio to occupy
Dascylium,<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a> which he easily performed; for the garrison
evacuated it. He himself advanced towards Sardis; and
when he was about 70 stades<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a> distant from that city, he
was met by Mithrines, the commandant of the garrison
in the Acropolis, accompanied by the most influential of
the citizens of Sardis. The latter surrendered the city
into his hands, and Mithrines the fortress and the money
laid up in it. Alexander encamped near the river Hermus,<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a>
which is about twenty stades<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a> distant from Sardis;
but he sent Amyntas, son of Andromenes, to occupy the
citadel of Sardis.<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">145</a> He took Mithrines with him, treating
him with honour; and granted the Sardians and
other Lydians the privilege of enjoying the ancient laws
of Lydia, and permitted them to be free. He then
ascended into the citadel, which was garrisoned by the
Persians. And the position seemed to him a strong one;
for it was very lofty, precipitous on every side, and
fenced round by a triple wall. He therefore resolved to
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>build a temple to the Olympian Zeus on the hill, and to
erect an altar in it; but while he was considering which
part of the hill was the most suitable site, suddenly a
winter storm arose, though it was the summer season,
loud claps of thunder were heard, and rain fell on the
spot where the palace of the kings of Lydia had stood.
From this Alexander thought that the deity had revealed
to him where the temple to Zeus ought to be built; and
he gave orders accordingly. He left Pausanias, one of
the Companions, to be superintendent of the citadel of
Sardis, Nicias to supervise the collection of the tribute
and taxes, and Asander, son of Philotas, to be superintendent
of Lydia and the rest of the dominion of Spithridates,
giving him as large a number of cavalry and
light-armed infantry as seemed sufficient for present
emergencies. He also sent Calas and Alexander, son of
Aëropus, into the country of Memnon,<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">146</a> in command of
the Peloponnesians and most of the other Grecian allies,
except the Argives, who had been left behind to guard
the citadel of Sardis.</p>

<p>Meantime, when the news of the cavalry battle was
spread abroad, the Grecian mercenaries who formed the
garrison of Ephesus, seized two of the Ephesian triremes
and set off in flight. They were accompanied
by Amyntas,<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a> son of Antiochus, who had fled from
Alexander out of Macedonia, not because he had received
any injury from the king, but from ill-will to him, and
thinking it not unlikely that he should suffer some ill-treatment
from him (on account of his disloyalty). On
the fourth day Alexander arrived at Ephesus, where
he recalled from exile all the men who had been banished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>from the city on account of their adherence to him;
and having broken up the oligarchy, he established a
democratical form of government there. He also ordered
the Ephesians to contribute to Artemis<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">148</a> all the tribute
which they were in the habit of paying to the Persians.
When the people of Ephesus were relieved of their
dread of the oligarchs, they rushed headlong to kill
the men who had brought Memnon into the city, as
also those who had pillaged the temple of Artemis, and
those who had thrown down the statue of Philip which
was in the temple, and those who had dug up and carried
off from the tomb in the market place the bones of
Heropythus, the liberator of their city. They also led
Syrphax, and his son Pelagon, and the sons of Syrphax’s
brothers out of the temple and stoned them to death.
But Alexander prevented them making any further quest
of the rest of the oligarchs for the purpose of wreaking
their vengeance upon them; for he knew that if the
people were not checked, they would kill the innocent
along with the guilty, some from hatred, and others for
the sake of seizing their property. At this time Alexander
gained great popularity both by his general course
of action and especially by what he did at Ephesus.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER XVIII.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Alexander Marches to Miletus and Occupies the Island
of Lade.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Men</span> now came to him both from Magnesia<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a> and Tralles,
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>offering to surrender those cities; and to them he sent
Parmenio, giving him 2,500 infantry from the Grecian
auxiliaries, an equal number of Macedonians, and about
200 of the Cavalry Companions. He also sent Lysimachus,
son of Agathocles,<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a> with an equal force to the
Aeolic cities,<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a> and to as many of the Ionic cities<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">152</a> as were
still under the Persians. He was ordered to break up
the oligarchies everywhere, to set up the democratical
form of government, to restore their own laws to each
of the cities, and to remit the tribute which they were
accustomed to pay to the foreigners. But Alexander
himself remained behind at Ephesus, where he offered a
sacrifice to Artemis and conducted a procession in her
honour with the whole of his army fully armed and
marshalled for battle.<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">153</a></p>

<p>On the following day he took the rest of his infantry,
the archers, the Agrianians, the Thracian cavalry, the
royal squadron of the Companions, and three other
squadrons in addition, and set out for Miletus. At his
first assault he captured that which was called the outer
city; for the garrison had evacuated it. There he encamped
and resolved to blockade the inner city; for
Hegesistratus, to whom the king Darius had entrusted
the command of the garrison in Miletus, kept on sending
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>letters before this to Alexander, offering to surrender
Miletus to him. But then, having regained his courage
from the fact that the Persian fleet was not far off, he
made up his mind to preserve the city for Darius. But
Nicanor, the commander of the Grecian fleet, anticipated
the Persians by sailing into the port of Miletus three
days before they approached; and with 160 ships he
anchored at the island of Lade, which lies near Miletus.<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">154</a>
The Persian ships arriving too late, and the admirals
discovering that Nicanor had occupied the anchorage
at Lade before them, they took moorings near Mount
Mycale.<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">155</a> Alexander had forestalled them in seizing the
island, not only by mooring his ships near it, but also by
transporting into it the Thracians and about 4,000 of the
other auxiliary troops. The ships of the foreigners were
about 400 in number.</p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Notwithstanding</span> the superiority of the Persian fleet,
Parmenio advised Alexander to fight a sea-battle, expecting
that the Greeks would be victorious with their
fleet both for other reasons and especially because an
omen from the deity made him confident of the result;
for an eagle had been seen sitting upon the shore,
opposite the sterns of Alexander’s ships.<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">156</a> He also
urged that if they won the battle, they would reap a
great advantage from it in regard to their main object in
the war; and if they were beaten, their defeat would not
be of any great moment; for even as it was, the Persians
held the sovereignty of the sea. He added that he was
willing to go on board the fleet himself and to share the
danger. However, Alexander replied that Parmenio was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>mistaken in his judgment, and did not explain the sign
according to probability. For it would be rash for him
with a few ships to fight a battle against a fleet far more
numerous than his own, and with his unpractised naval
force to contend against the disciplined fleet of the
Cyprians and Phoenicians. Besides, he did not wish to
deliver over to the foreigners on so unstable an element
the advantage which the Macedonians derived from their
skill and courage; and if they were beaten in the sea-battle,
their defeat would be no small hindrance to their
final success in the war, both for other reasons, and
especially because the Greeks, being animated with
courage at the news of his naval defeat, would attempt to
effect a revolution. Taking all these things into consideration,
he declared that he did not think that it was
a suitable time for fighting a sea-battle; and for his
part, he expounded the divine omen in a different way.
He admitted that the eagle was in his favour; but as it
was seen sitting on the land, it seemed to him rather to
be a sign that he should get the mastery over the Persian
fleet by defeating their army on land.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER XIX.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Siege and Capture of Miletus.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">At</span> this time Glaucippus, one of the most notable men in
Miletus, was sent out to Alexander by the people and
the Grecian mercenaries, to whom rather than to the
citizens the town had been entrusted, to tell him that
the Milesians were willing to make their walls and
harbours<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">157</a> free to him and the Persians in common; and
on these terms to demand that he should raise the siege.
But Alexander ordered Glaucippus to depart without
delay into the city, and tell the citizens to prepare for
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>a battle at daybreak. He then stationed his military
engines near the wall, and having in a short time partly
broken and partly shaken down a large piece of it, he
led his army near, that the men might enter wherever
the wall had been thrown down or shaken. The Persians
from Mycale were following close<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">158</a> upon them and could
almost see their friends and allies being besieged. In
the meantime, Nicanor, observing from Lade Alexander’s
commencement of the attack, began to sail into the
harbour of Miletus, rowing along the shore; and mooring
his triremes as close as possible together, with their
prows facing the enemy, across the narrowest part of the
mouth of the harbour, he shut off the Persian fleet from
the port and made it impossible for the Persians to give
succour to the Milesians. Then the Macedonians from all
sides pressed close upon the citizens and the Grecian
mercenaries, who took to flight; some of them, casting
themselves into the sea, floated along upon their shields
with the hollow upwards to an unnamed islet which
lies near the city; others getting into their skiffs and
hastening to get the start of the Macedonian triremes,
were captured by them at the mouth of the harbour.
But the majority of them were slain in the city itself.
As soon as Alexander had got possession of the city, he
sailed against those who had fled for refuge into the
island; ordering the men to carry ladders upon the
prows of the triremes, with the intention of effecting a
landing along the cliffs of the island, as one would mount
a wall. But when he saw that the men on the island
were resolved to run every risk, he was moved with pity
for them, because they appeared to him both brave and
loyal; wherefore he made a truce with them on the
condition that they would serve as his soldiers. These
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>Grecian mercenaries were about 300 in number. He
likewise pardoned all the citizens of Miletus who had
escaped death in the capture of the city, and he granted
them their freedom.</p>

<p>The foreigners used to start from Mycale every day
and sail up to the Grecian fleet, hoping to induce them to
accept the challenge and come forth to a battle; but
during the night they used to moor their vessels near
Mycale, which was an inconvenient station, because they
were under the necessity of fetching water from the
mouth of the river Maeander, a great way off.<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">159</a> Alexander
guarded the harbour of Miletus with his ships, in order
to prevent the foreigners from forcing an entrance; and at
the same time he sent Philotas to Mycale in command of
the cavalry and three regiments of infantry, with instructions
to prevent the men in the ships from landing. Accordingly,
they, being through the scarcity of fresh water
and of the other necessaries of life as good as besieged
in their ships, sailed away to Samos; where furnishing
themselves with food, they sailed back again to Miletus.
They then drew up most of their ships in front of the
harbour on the deep sea, with the hope that they might
in some way or other induce the Macedonians to come
out into the open sea. Five of their ships sailed into
the roadstead which lay between the island of Lade and
the camp, expecting to surprise Alexander’s ships while
empty of their crews; for they had ascertained that the
sailors for the most part were dispersed from the ships,
some to gather fuel, others to collect provisions, and
others being arranged in foraging parties.<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">160</a> And indeed
it happened that a number of the sailors were absent;
but as soon as Alexander observed the five Persian ships
sailing towards him, he manned ten ships with the sailors
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>who happened to be at hand, and sent them with all
speed against them with orders to attack prow to prow.
No sooner did the men in the five Persian ships see the
Macedonians bearing up against them, contrary to their
expectation, than they immediately tacked about, though
far off, and fled to the rest of their fleet. However, the
ship of the Iassians,<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">161</a> not being a fast sailer, was captured
in the flight, men and all; but the other four succeeded in
escaping to their own triremes. After this the Persians
sailed away from Miletus without effecting anything.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER XX.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Siege of Halicarnassus.&mdash;Abortive Attack on
Myndus.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Alexander</span> now resolved to disband his fleet, partly from
lack of money at the time, and partly because he saw
that his own fleet was not a match in battle for that of
the Persians. On this account he was unwilling to run
the risk of losing even a part of his armament. Besides,
he considered, that now he was occupying Asia with his
land force, he would no longer be in need of a fleet;
and that he would be able to break up that of the
Persians, if he captured the maritime cities; since they
would neither have any ports from which they could
recruit their crews, nor any harbour in Asia to which
they could bring their ships. Thus he explained the omen
of the eagle to signify that he should get the mastery
over the enemy’s ships by his land force. After doing
this, be set forth into Caria,<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">162</a> because it was reported
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>that a considerable force, both of foreigners and of Grecian
auxiliaries, had collected in Halicarnassus.<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">163</a> Having
taken all the cities between Miletus and Halicarnassus
as soon as he approached them, he encamped near the
latter city, at a distance from it of about five stades,<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">164</a> as
if he expected a long siege. For the natural position of
the place made it strong; and wherever there seemed to
be any deficiency in security, it had been entirely supplied
long before by Memnon, who was there in person, having
now been proclaimed by Darius governor of lower Asia
and commander of the entire fleet. Many Grecian mercenary
soldiers had been left in the city, as well as many
Persian troops; the triremes also were moored in the
harbour, so that the sailors might render him valuable
aid in the operations. On the first day of the siege,
while Alexander was leading his men up to the wall in
the direction of the gate leading towards Mylasa,<a name="FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">165</a> the
men in the city made a sortie, and a skirmish took place;
but Alexander’s men making a rush upon them repulsed
them with ease, and shut them up in the city. A few
days after this, the king took the shield-bearing guards,
the Cavalry Companions, the infantry regiments of Amyntas,
Perdiccas and Meleager, and in addition to these the
archers and Agrianians, and went round to the part of
the city which is in the direction of Myndus, both for the
purpose of inspecting the wall, to see if it happened to be
more easy to be assaulted there than elsewhere; and at
the same time to see if he could get hold of Myndus<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">166</a> by
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>a sudden and secret attack. For he thought that if
Myndus were his own, it would be no small help in the
siege of Halicarnassus; moreover, an offer to surrender
had been made by the Myndians if he would approach
the town secretly, under the cover of night. About midnight,
therefore, he approached the wall, according to
the plan agreed on; but as no sign of surrender was
made by the men within, and though he had with him no
military engines or ladders, inasmuch as he had not set
out to besiege the town, but to receive it on surrender,
he nevertheless led the Macedonian phalanx near and
ordered them to undermine the wall. They threw down
one of the towers, which, however, in its fall did not
make a breach in the wall. But the men in the city
stoutly defending themselves, and at the same time many
from Halicarnassus having already come to their aid by
sea, made it impossible for Alexander to capture Myndus
by surprise or sudden assault. Wherefore he returned
without accomplishing any of the plans for which he had
set out, and devoted himself once more to the siege of
Halicarnassus.</p>

<p>In the first place he filled up with earth the ditch
which the enemy had dug in front of the city, about
thirty cubits wide and fifteen deep; so that it might
be easy to bring forward the towers, from which he
intended to discharge missiles against the defenders of
the wall; and that he might bring up the other engines
with which he was planning to batter the wall down.
He easily filled up the ditch, and the towers were then
brought forward. But the men in Halicarnassus made a
sally by night with the design of setting fire both to the
towers and the other engines which had been brought
up to the wall, or were nearly brought up to it. They
were, however, easily repelled and shut up again within
the walls by the Macedonians who were guarding the
engines, and by others who were aroused by the noise of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
the struggle and who came to their aid. Neoptolemus,
the brother of Arrhabaeus, son of Amyntas, one of those
who had deserted to Darius, was killed, with about 170
others of the enemy. Of Alexander’s soldiers sixteen
were killed and 300 wounded; for the sally being made
in the night, they were less able to guard themselves
from being wounded.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER XXI.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Siege of Halicarnassus.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">A</span> few days after this, two Macedonian hoplites of the
brigade of Perdiccas, living in the same tent and being
messmates, happened in the course of conversation each
to be extolling himself and his own exploits. Hence a
quarrel arose between them as to which of them was the
braver, and, being somewhat inflamed with wine, they
agreed to arm themselves, and of their own accord go
and assault the wall facing the citadel, which for the most
part was turned towards Mylasa. This they did rather
to make a display of their own valour than to engage in
a dangerous conflict with the enemy. Some of the men
in the city, however, perceiving that there were only two
of them, and that they were approaching the wall inconsiderately,
rushed out upon them; but they slew those
who came near, and hurled darts at those who stood at a
distance. At last, however, they were overmatched both
by the number of their assailants and the disadvantage
of their own position; for the enemy made the attack
upon them, and threw darts at them from a higher level.<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">167</a>
Meanwhile some other men from the brigade of Perdiccas,
and others from Halicarnassus, rushed out against each
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>other; and a sharp contest ensued near the wall. Those
who had made the sally from the city were driven back,
and again shut up within the gates by the Macedonians.
The city also narrowly escaped capture; for the walls at
that time were not under strict guard, and two towers,
with the whole intermediate space, having already fallen
to the ground, would have offered an easy entrance within
the wall to the army, if the whole of it had undertaken
the task. The third tower, which had been thoroughly
shaken, would likewise have been easily thrown down if
it had been undermined; but the enemy easily succeeded
in building inside a crescent-shaped brick wall to take
the place of the one which had fallen. This they were
able to do so quickly because of the multitude of hands
at their disposal. On the following day Alexander
brought his engines up to this wall also; and the men in
the city made another sally to set them on fire. A part
of the wicker-work shed near the wall and a piece of one
of the wooden towers were burnt, but the rest were
protected by Philotas and Hellanicus, to whom the
charge of them had been committed. But as soon as
those who were making the sally saw Alexander, the
men who had come out to render aid by holding torches
threw them away, and the majority of them cast away
their arms and fled within the walls of the city. Then at
first they had the advantage from the nature of their
position, which was commanding on account of its
height; for not only did they cast missiles right in front
against the men who were guarding the engines, but also
from the towers which alone had been left standing at
each end of the battered-down wall, they were able to
cast them against the sides, and almost against the backs,
of those who were assaulting the wall which had just
been built in place of the ruined one.<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">168</a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXII.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Siege of Halicarnassus.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">A</span> few days after this, when Alexander again brought
his military engines up to the inner brick wall, and was
himself superintending the work, a sortie in mass was
made from the city, some advancing by the breach in
the wall, where Alexander himself was posted, others by
the triple gate, where the Macedonians did not at all
expect them. The first party cast torches and other
combustibles at the engines, in order to set them on fire
and to defy the engineers excessively. But when the
men around Alexander attacked them vigorously, hurling
great stones with the engines from the towers, and
launching darts at them, they were easily put to rout
and fled into the city; and as a great number of them
had sallied forth and great audacity had been exhibited
in the fight, no small slaughter of them took place. For
some of them were slain fighting hand-to-hand with the
Macedonians, others were killed near the ruins of the
wall,<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">169</a> because the breach was too narrow for such a
multitude to pass through, and the fragments of the
wall made it difficult for them to scale it. The second
party, which sallied forth by the triple gate, was met by
Ptolemy,<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">170</a> one of the royal body-guards, who had with
him the regiments of Addaeus and Timander and some
of the light-armed troops. These soldiers by themselves
easily put the men of the city to rout; but as the latter
in their retreat were fleeing over a narrow bridge which
had been made over the ditch, they had the misfortune
to break it down by the weight of their multitude.
Many of them fell into the ditch, some of whom were
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>trampled to death by their own comrades, and others
were killed by the Macedonian weapons from above. A
very great slaughter was also made at the very gates,
because they were shut before the proper time in a state
of panic. For the enemy, being afraid that the Macedonians,
who were close upon the fugitives, would rush
in with them, shut many of their friends out, who were
slain by the Macedonians near the very walls. The city
narrowly escaped capture; indeed it would have been
taken, had not Alexander called back his army, to see if
some friendly sign of surrender would be made by the
Halicarnassians; for he was still desirous of saving their
city. Of the men in the city about one thousand were
slain; and of Alexander’s men about forty, among whom
were Ptolemy, one of the king’s body-guards, Clearchus,
a captain of the archers, Addaeus, who had the command
of a thousand infantry, and other Macedonians of no
mean position.<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">171</a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIII.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Destruction of Halicarnassus.&mdash;Ada, Queen of Caria.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Then</span> Orontobates and Memnon, the commanders of the
Persians, met and decided from the state of affairs that
they could not hold out long against the siege, seeing
that part of the wall had already fallen down and part
had been battered and weakened, and that many of their
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>soldiers had either perished in the sorties or been
wounded and disabled. Taking these things into consideration,
about the second watch of the night they set
fire to the wooden tower which they had themselves
built to resist the enemy’s military engines, and to the
magazines in which their weapons were stored. They
also cast fire into the houses near the wall; and others
were burned by the flames, which were carried with great
fury from the magazines and the tower by the wind
bearing in that direction. Some of the enemy then
withdrew to the stronghold in the island (called Arconnesus),
and others to another fortress called Salmacis.
When this was reported to Alexander by some deserters
from the incendiaries, and he himself could see the
raging fire, though the occurrence took place about
midnight, yet he led out the Macedonians and slew those
who were still engaged in setting fire to the city. But
he issued orders to preserve all the Halicarnassians who
should be taken in their houses. As soon as the daylight
appeared he could discern the strongholds which
the Persians and the Grecian mercenaries had occupied;
but he decided not to besiege them, considering that he
would meet with no small delay beleaguering them, from
the nature of their position, and moreover thinking that
they would be of little importance to him now that he
had captured the whole city.</p>

<p>Wherefore, burying the dead in the night, he ordered
the men who had been placed in charge of the military
engines to convey them to Tralles. He himself marched
into Phrygia, after razing the city to the ground, and
leaving 3,000 Grecian infantry and 200 cavalry as a
guard both of this place and of the rest of Caria, under
the command of Ptolemy. He appointed Ada to act
as his viceroy of the whole of Caria.<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">172</a> This queen was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>daughter of Hecatomnus and wife of Hidrieus, who,
though he was her brother, lived with her in wedlock,
according to the custom of the Carians. When Hidrieus
was dying, he confided the administration of affairs to
her, for it had been a custom in Asia, ever since the
time of Semiramis, even for women to rule men. But
Pixodarus expelled her from the rule, and seized the
administration of affairs himself. On the death of
Pixodarus, his son-in-law Orontobates was sent by the
king of the Persians to rule over the Carians. Ada
retained Alinda alone, the strongest place in Caria; and
when Alexander invaded Caria she went to meet him,
offering to surrender Alinda to him, and adopting him
as her son.<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">173</a> Alexander confided Alinda to her, and did
not think the title of son unworthy of his acceptance;
moreover, when he had captured Halicarnassus and become
master of the rest of Caria, he granted her the
privilege of ruling over the whole country.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER XXIV.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Alexander in Lycia and Pamphylia.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Some</span> of the Macedonians who served in Alexander’s
army had married just before he undertook the expedition.
He thought that he ought not to treat these men
with neglect, and therefore sent them back from Caria
to spend the winter in Macedonia with their wives. He
placed them under the command of Ptolemy, son of
Seleucus, one of the royal body-guards, and of the two
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>generals Coenus, son of Polemocrates, and Meleager, son
of Neoptolemus, because they were also newly married.
He gave these officers instructions to levy as many horse
and foot soldiers as they could from the country, when
they returned to him and brought back the men who
had been sent away with them. By this act more than
by any other Alexander acquired popularity among the
Macedonians. He also sent Cleander, son of Polemocrates,
to levy soldiers in Peloponnesus,<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">174</a> and Parmenio to
Sardis, giving him the command of a regiment of the
Cavalry Companions, the Thessalian cavalry, and the rest
of the Grecian allies. He ordered him to take the
wagons to Sardis and to advance from that place into
Phrygia.</p>

<p>He himself marched towards Lycia and Pamphylia,
in order to gain command of the coastland, and by that
means render the enemy’s fleet useless. The first place
on his route was Hyparna, a strong position, having a
garrison of Grecian mercenaries; but he took it at the
first assault, and allowed the Greeks to depart from
the citadel under a truce. Then he invaded Lycia and
brought over the Telmissians by capitulation; and crossing
the river Xanthus, the cities of Pinara, Xanthus,
Patara, and about thirty other smaller towns were surrendered
to him.<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">175</a> Having accomplished this, though it
was now the very depth of winter, he invaded the land
called Milyas,<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">176</a> which is a part of Great Phrygia, but at
that time paid tribute to Lycia, according to an arrangement
made by the Great King. Hither came envoys
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>from the Phaselites,<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">177</a> to treat for his friendship, and to
crown him with a golden crown; and the majority of the
maritime Lycians also sent heralds to him as ambassadors
to treat for the same object. He ordered the Phaselites
and Lycians to surrender their cities to those who were
despatched by him to receive them; and they were all
surrendered. He soon afterwards arrived himself at
Phaselis, and helped the men of that city to capture a
strong fort which had been constructed by the Pisidians
to overawe the country; and sallying forth from which
those barbarians used to inflict much damage upon the
Phaselites who tilled the land.<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">178</a></p>

<hr />

<h3>CHAPTER XXV.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Treason of Alexander, Son of Aëropus.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">While</span> the king was still near Phaselis he received information
that Alexander, son of Aëropus, who was not
only one of the Companions, but also at that time commander
of the Thessalian horse, was conspiring against
him. This Alexander was brother of Heromenes and
Arrhabaeus, who had taken part in the murder of Philip.<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">179</a>
At that time King Alexander pardoned him, though he
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>was accused of complicity with them, because after
Philip’s death he was among the first of his friends to
come to him, and, helping him on with his breastplate,
accompanied him to the palace. The king afterwards
showed him honour at his court, sent him as general into
Thrace; and when Calas the commander of the Thessalian
horse was sent away to a viceroyalty<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">180</a> he was appointed
to succeed that general. The details of the conspiracy
were reported as follows: When Amyntas deserted to
Darius,<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">181</a> he conveyed to him certain messages and a
letter from this Alexander. Darius then sent Sisines,
one of his own faithful Persian courtiers, down to the
sea-coast, under pretence of going to Atizyes, viceroy of
Phrygia, but really to communicate with this Alexander,
and to give him pledges, that if he would kill king
Alexander, Darius would appoint him king of Macedonia,
and would give him 1,000 talents of gold<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">182</a> in addition to
the kingdom. But Sisines, being captured by Parmenio,
told him the real object of his mission. Parmenio sent
him immediately under guard to the king, who obtained
the same intelligence from him. The king then, having
collected his friends, proposed to them as a subject for
deliberation what decision he ought to make in regard
to this Alexander. The Companions thought that formerly
he had not resolved wisely in confiding the best
part of his cavalry to a faithless man, and that now it
was advisable to put him out of the way as speedily as
possible, before he became even more popular among the
Thessalians and should try to effect some revolutionary
plan with their aid. Moreover they were terrified by a
certain divine portent. For, while Alexander the king
was still besieging Halicarnassus, it is said that he was
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>once taking rest at midday, when a swallow flew
about over his head loudly twittering, and perched now
on this side of his couch and now on that, chirping more
noisily than usual. On account of his fatigue he could
not be roused from sleep, but being disquieted by the
sound he brushed her away gently with his hand. But
though struck she was so far from trying to escape, that
she perched upon the very head of the king, and did
not desist until he was wide awake. Thinking the affair
of the swallow of no trivial import, he communicated it
to a soothsayer, Aristander the Telmissian,<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">183</a> who told
him that it signified a plot formed by one of his friends.
He said it also signified that the plot would be discovered,
because the swallow was a bird fond of man’s
society and well disposed to him as well as more loquacious
than any other bird. Therefore, comparing this
with the depositions of the Persian, the king sent
Amphoterus, son of Alexander and brother of Craterus
to Parmenio; and with him he sent some Pergaeans to
show him the way. Amphoterus, putting on a native
dress, so that he should not be recognised on the road,
reached Parmenio by stealth. He did not carry a letter
from Alexander, because it did not appear to the king
advisable to write openly about such a matter; but he
reported the message entrusted to him by word of mouth.
Consequently this Alexander was arrested and kept
under guard.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER XXVI.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Alexander in Pamphylia.&mdash;Capture of Aspendus
and Side.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Alexander</span> then, moving from Phaselis, sent part of
his army to Perga through the mountains, where the
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>Thracians had levelled a road for him by a route which
was otherwise difficult and long. But he himself led his
own brigade by the beach along the sea, where there is
no route, except when the north wind blows. But if the
south wind prevails it is impossible to journey along the
beach. At that time, after a strong south wind, the
north winds blew, and rendered his passage easy and
quick, not without the divine intervention, as both he
and his men interpreted.<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">184</a> As he was advancing from
Perga, he was met on the road by envoys from the
Aspendians<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">185</a> with full powers, who offered to surrender
their city, but begged him not lead a garrison into it.
Having gained their request in regard to the garrison,
they went back; but he ordered them to give him fifty
talents<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">186</a> as pay for his army, as well as the horses which
they were rearing as tribute to Darius. Having agreed
with him about the money, and having likewise promised
to hand over the horses, they departed.</p>

<p>Alexander then marched to Sidē,<a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">187</a> the inhabitants of
which were Cymaeans from Cyme, in Aeolis. These
people give the following account of themselves, saying
that their ancestors starting from Cyme, arrived in that
country, and disembarked to found a settlement. They
immediately forgot the Grecian language, and forthwith
began to utter a foreign speech, not, indeed, that of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>neighbouring barbarians, but a speech peculiar to themselves,
which had never before existed. From that time
the Sidetans used to speak a foreign language unlike
that of the neighbouring nations. Having left a garrison
in Sidē, Alexander advanced to Syllium,<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">188</a> a strong place,
containing a garrison of Grecian mercenaries as well as
of native barbarians themselves. But he was unable to
take Syllium offhand by a sudden assault, for he was
informed on his march that the Aspendians refused to
perform any of their agreements, and would neither
deliver the horses to those who were sent to receive
them, nor pay the money; but that they had collected
their property out of the fields into the city, shut their
gates against his men, and were repairing their walls
where they had become dilapidated. Hearing this, he
marched off to Aspendus.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER XXVII.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Alexander in Phrygia and Pisidia.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">The</span> greater part of Aspendus had been built upon a
strong and precipitous rock, at the very foot of which
flows the river Eurymedon<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">189</a>; but round the rock, on the
low ground, were many of the citizens’ houses, surrounded
by a small wall. As soon as they ascertained
that Alexander was approaching, the inhabitants
deserted the wall and the houses situated on the low
ground, which they thought they were unable to protect;
and they fled in a body to the rock. When he arrived
with his forces, he passed within the deserted wall and
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>took up his quarters in the houses which had been
abandoned by the Aspendians. When these saw that
Alexander himself had come, contrary to their expectation,
and that his camp was encircling them on all sides,
they sent envoys to him, entreating him to form an
agreement with them on the former terms. Alexander,
considering the strength of the place, and how unprepared
he was to undertake a long siege, entered into an
agreement with them, though not on the same terms as
before. For he ordered them to give him their most
influential men as hostages, to hand over the horses
which they had formerly agreed to give him, to pay
100 talents instead of fifty, to obey the viceroy appointed
by him, and to pay an annual tribute to the Macedonians.
Moreover he directed an inquiry to be held about the
land which they were accused of holding by force,
though it belonged of right to their neighbours.</p>

<p>When all these concessions had been made to him, he
marched away to Perga, and thence set out for Phrygia,
his route leading him past the city of Termessus. The
people of this city are foreigners, of the Pisidian race,
inhabiting a very lofty place, precipitous on every side;
so that the road to the city is a difficult one. For a
mountain stretches from the city as far as the road,
where it suddenly stops short; and over against it rises
another mountain, no less precipitous. These mountains
form gates, as it were, upon the road; and it is possible
for those who occupy these eminences even with a small
guard to render the passage impracticable. On this
occasion the Termissians had come out in a body, and
were occupying both the mountains; seeing which,
Alexander ordered the Macedonians to encamp there,
armed as they were, imagining that the Termissians
would not remain in a body when they saw them
bivouacking, but that most of them would withdraw into
their city, which was near, leaving upon the mountains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
only sufficient men to form a guard. And it turned out
just as he conjectured; for most of them retired, and
only a guard remained. He forthwith took the archers,
the regiments of javelin-throwers, and the lighter
hoplites, and led them against those who were guarding
the pass. When these were attacked with missiles, they
did not stand their ground, but abandoned the position.
Alexander then passed through the defile, and encamped
near the city.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Operations in Pisidia.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">While</span> he was there, ambassadors came to him from the
Selgians, who are also Pisidian barbarians, inhabiting a
large city, and being warlike. Because they happened
to be inveterate enemies to the Termessians they had
despatched this embassy to Alexander, to treat for his
friendship. He made a treaty with them, and from this
time found them faithful allies in all his proceedings.
Despairing of being able to capture Termessus without a
great loss of time, he marched on to Sagalassus. This
was also a large city, inhabited likewise by Pisidians;
and though all the Pisidians are warlike, the men of this
city were deemed the most so. On this occasion they
had occupied the hill in front of the city, because it was
no less strong than the walls, from which to attack the
enemy; and there they were awaiting him. But Alexander
drew up the phalanx of Macedonians in the following
way: on the right wing, where he had himself taken
up his position, he held the shield-bearing guards, and
next to these he extended the foot Companions as far as
the left wing, in the order that each of the generals had
precedence in the array that day. On the left wing he
stationed Amyntas, son of Arrhabaeus, as commander.<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
In front of the right wing were posted the archers and
Agrianians, and in front of the left wing the Thracian
javelin-throwers under the command of Sitalces. But
the cavalry were no use to him in a place so rough and
unfavourable. The Termessians also had come to the
aid of the Pisidians, and arrayed themselves with them.
Alexander had already made an attack upon the mountain
which the Pisidians were occupying, advancing up the
most abrupt part of the ascent, when the barbarians
from an ambuscade attacked him on both wings, in a
place where it was very easy for themselves to advance,
but where the route was very difficult for their enemy.
The archers, who were the first to approach, were put to
rout, inasmuch as they were insufficiently armed; but
the Agrianians stood their ground, for the Macedonian
phalanx was already drawing near, at the head of which
Alexander himself was seen. When the battle became a
hand-to-hand one, though the barbarians were destitute
of armour, they rushed against the Macedonian hoplites,
and fell wounded on all sides. Then, indeed, they gave
way, after about 500 of them had been killed. As they
were nimble and well-acquainted with the locality, they
effected their retreat without difficulty; whereas the
Macedonians, on account of the heaviness of their arms
and their ignorance of the roads, durst not pursue them
vigorously. Alexander therefore held off from the
fugitives, and took their city by storm. Of those with
him, Cleander, the general of the archers, and about
twenty others were slain. Alexander then marched
against the rest of the Pisidians, and took some of their
strongholds by storm; others he won over to him by
granting them terms of capitulation.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIX.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Alexander in Phrygia.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Thence</span> he went into Phrygia, passing by the lake called
Ascania,<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">190</a> in which salt is naturally concreted. The
natives use this salt, and do not need the sea at all for
this article. On the fifth day of his march, he arrived at
Celaenae,<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">191</a> in which city there was a fortified rock, precipitous
on all sides. This citadel was occupied by the
viceroy of Phrygia with a garrison of 1,000 Carians and
100 Grecian mercenaries. These men despatched ambassadors
to Alexander, promising to surrender the place to
him, if succour did not reach them by a day which had
been agreed upon with them, naming the day.<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">192</a> This
arrangement seemed to Alexander more advantageous
than to besiege the fortified rock, which was inaccessible
on all sides to attack. At Celaenae he left a garrison of
1,500 soldiers. Remaining here ten days, he appointed
Antigonus, son of Philip,<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">193</a> viceroy of Phrygia, placed
Balacrus, son of Amyntas<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">194</a> as general over the Grecian
allies in place of Antigonus, and then directed his march
to Gordium.<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">195</a> He sent an order to Parmenio to meet
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>him there with the forces under his command; an order
which that general obeyed. The newly-married men
also, who had been despatched to Macedonia, now arrived
at Gordium, and with them another army which had
been levied, and put under the command of Ptolemy, son
of Seleucus,<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">196</a> Coenus, son of Polemocrates, and Meleager,
son of Neoptolemus. This army consisted of 3,000
Macedonian foot-soldiers and 300 horse-soldiers, 200
Thessalian cavalry, and 150 Eleans under the command
of Alcias the Elean.</p>

<p>Gordium is in the Phrygia which lies near the
Hellespont, and is situated upon the river Sangarius,
which takes its rise in Phrygia, but, flowing through
the land of the Bithynian Thracians, falls into the Euxine
Sea. Here an embassy reached Alexander from the
Athenians, beseeching him to release to them the Athenian
prisoners who had been captured at the river
Granicus, fighting for the Persians, and were then in
Macedonia serving in chains with the two thousand
others captured in that battle. The envoys departed
without obtaining their request on behalf of the prisoners
for the present. For Alexander did not think it safe,
whilst the war against the Persian was still going on, to
relax in the slightest degree the terror with which he
inspired the Greeks, who did not deem it unbecoming
for them to serve as soldiers on behalf of the foreigners
against Greece. However, he replied that whenever his
present enterprise had been successfully achieved, they
might then come as ambassadors to treat on behalf of
the same persons.<a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">197</a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Capture of Mitylene by the Persians.&mdash;Death of
Memnon.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Soon</span> after this, Memnon, whom King Darius had appointed
commander of the whole fleet and of the entire
sea-coast, with the design of moving the seat of war into
Macedonia and Greece, acquired possession of Chios,
which was surrendered to him by treachery. Thence
he sailed to Lesbos and brought over to his side all
the cities of the island,<a name="FNanchor_198" id="FNanchor_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">198</a> except Mitylene, the inhabitants
of which did not submit to him. When he had gained
these cities over, he turned his attention to Mitylene;
and walling off the city from the rest of the island by
constructing a double stockade from sea to sea, he easily
got the mastery on the land side by building five camps.
A part of his fleet guarded their harbour, and, intercepting
the ships passing by, he kept the rest of his fleet as
a guard off Sigrium,<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">199</a> the headland of Lesbos, where is
the best landing-place for trading vessels from Chios,
Geraestus,<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">200</a> and Malea.<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">201</a> By this means he deprived the
Mitylenaeans of all hope of succour by sea. But mean<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>time
he himself fell ill and died, and his death at that
crisis was exceedingly injurious to the king’s interests.
Nevertheless Autophradates, and Pharnabazus, son of
Artabazus, prosecuted the siege with vigour. To the
latter indeed, Memnon, when dying, had entrusted his
command, as he was his sister’s son, till Darius should
come to some decision on the matter. The Mitylenaeans,
therefore, being excluded from the land, and being
blockaded on the sea by many ships lying at anchor,
sent to Pharnabazus and came to the following agreement:&mdash;That
the auxiliary troops which had come to
their aid from Alexander should depart, that the citizens
should demolish the pillars on which the treaty made by
them with Alexander was inscribed,<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">202</a> that they should
become allies of Darius on the terms of the peace which
was made with King Darius in the time of Antalcidas,<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">203</a>
and that their exiles should return from banishment on
condition of receiving back half the property which they
possessed when they were banished. Upon these terms
the compact was made between the Mitylenaeans and
the Persians. But as soon as Pharnabazus and Autophradates
once got within the city, they introduced a
garrison with Lycomedes, a Rhodian, as its commandant.
They also appointed Diogenes, one of the exiles, to be
despot of the city, and exacted money from the Mitylenaeans,
taking part of it by violence for themselves from
the wealthy citizens, and laying the rest as a tax upon
the community.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Persians Capture Tenedus.&mdash;They are Defeated
at Sea.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">After</span> accomplishing this, Pharnabazus sailed to Lycia,
taking with him the Grecian mercenaries; but Autophradates
sailed to the other islands. Meantime Darius sent
Thymondas, son of Mentor,<a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">204</a> down to the maritime districts,
to take over the Grecian auxiliaries from Pharnabazus
and to lead them up to him; and to tell Pharnabazus
that he was to be the ruler of all that Memnon
had ruled. So Pharnabazus handed over to him the
Grecian auxiliaries and then sailed to join Autophradates
and the fleet. When they met, they despatched
Datames, a Persian, with ten ships to the islands called
Cyclades,<a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">205</a> whilst they with 100 sailed to Tenedus.<a name="FNanchor_206" id="FNanchor_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">206</a>
Having sailed into the harbour of Tenedus which is
called Borēus, they sent a message to the inhabitants,
commanding them to demolish the pillars on which the
treaty made by them with Alexander and the Greeks was
inscribed, and to observe in regard to Darius the terms
of the peace which they had ratified with the king of
Persia in the time of Antalcidas. The Tenedians preferred
to be on terms of amity with Alexander and the
Greeks; but in the present crisis it seemed impossible
to save themselves except by yielding to the Persians,
since Hegelochus, who had been commissioned by Alexander
to collect another naval force, had not yet gathered
so large a fleet as to warrant them in expecting any
speedy succour from him. Accordingly Pharnabazus
made the Tenedians comply with his demands rather
from fear than good-will.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span></p>

<p>Meantime Proteas, son of Andronicus, by command of
Antipater,<a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">207</a> succeeded in collecting ships of war from
Euboea and the Peloponnese, so that there might be
some protection both for the islands and for Greece
itself, if the foreigners attacked them by sea, as it was
reported they intended to do. Learning that Datames
with ten ships was moored near Siphnus,<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">208</a> Proteas set
out by night with fifteen from Chalcis on the Euripus,<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">209</a>
and approaching the island of Cythnus<a name="FNanchor_210" id="FNanchor_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">210</a> at dawn, he
spent the day there in order to get more certain information
of the movements of the ten ships, resolving at the
same time to fall upon the Phoenicians by night, when
he would be likely to strike them with greater terror.
Having discovered with certainty that Datames was
moored with his ships at Siphnus, he sailed thither while
it was still dark, and just at the very dawn fell upon
them when they least expected it, and captured eight of
the ships, men and all. But Datames, with the other
two triremes, escaped by stealth at the beginning of the
attack made by the ships with Proteas, and reached the
rest of the Persian fleet in safety.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Alexander at Gordium.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">When</span> Alexander arrived at Gordium, he was seized with
an ardent desire to go up into the citadel, which contained
the palace of Gordius and his son Midas. He was
also desirous of seeing the wagon of Gordius and the
cord which bound the yoke to the wagon. There was a
great deal of talk about this wagon among the neighbouring
population. It was said that Gordius was a
poor man among the ancient Phrygians, who had a small
piece of land to till, and two yoke of oxen. He used
one of these in ploughing and the other to draw the
wagon. On one occasion, while he was ploughing, an
eagle settled upon the yoke,<a name="FNanchor_211" id="FNanchor_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">211</a> and remained sitting there
until the time came for unyoking the oxen. Being
alarmed at the sight, he went to the Telmissian soothsayers
to consult them about the sign from the deity;
for the Telmissians were skilful in interpreting the meaning
of Divine manifestations, and the power of divination
has been bestowed not only upon the men, but also upon
their wives and children from generation to generation.
When Gordius was driving his wagon near a certain
village of the Telmissians, he met a maiden fetching
water from the spring, and to her he related how the
sign of the eagle had appeared to him. As she herself
was of the prophetic race, she instructed him to return
to the very spot and offer sacrifice to Zeus the king.
Gordius requested her to accompany him and direct him
how to perform the sacrifice. He offered the sacrifice in
the way the girl suggested, and afterwards married her.
A son was born to them named Midas, who, when he
arrived at the age of maturity, was both handsome and
valiant. At this time the Phrygians were harassed by
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>civil discord, and consulting the oracle, they were told
that a wagon would bring them a king, who would put
an end to their discord.<a name="FNanchor_212" id="FNanchor_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">212</a> While they were still deliberating
about this very matter, Midas arrived with his
father and mother, and stopped near the assembly with
the very wagon in question. They, interpreting the
oracular response to refer to him, decided that this was
the person whom the god told them the wagon would
bring. They therefore appointed Midas king; and he,
putting an end to their discord, dedicated his father’s
wagon in the citadel as a thank-offering to Zeus the
king for sending the eagle. In addition to this the
following report was current concerning the wagon, that
whosoever could loosen the cord with which the yoke of
the wagon was tied, was destined to be the ruler of Asia.
The cord was made of cornel bark, and neither end nor
beginning to it could be seen. It is said by some that
when Alexander could find out no way to loosen the cord
and yet was unwilling to allow it to remain unloosened,
lest it should exercise some disturbing influence upon
the multitude, he struck the cord with his sword and cut
it through, saying that it had been untied by him. But
Aristobulus says that he pulled out the pin of the wagon-pole,
which was a wooden peg driven right through it,
holding the cord together. Having done this, he drew
out the yoke from the wagon-pole. How Alexander
performed the feat in connection with this cord, I cannot
affirm with confidence. At any rate both he and
his troops departed from the wagon as if the oracular
prediction concerning the untying of the cord had been
fulfilled. Moreover, that very night, the thunder and
lightning were signs from heaven of its fulfilment; and
for this reason Alexander offered sacrifice on the following
day to the gods who had revealed the signs and
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>assured him that the cord had been untied in a proper
way.<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">213</a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Conquest of Cappadocia.&mdash;Alexander’s Illness at
Tarsus.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">The</span> next day he sent out to Ancyra<a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">214</a> in Galatia, where
he was met by an embassy from the Paphlagonians,
offering to surrender their nation to him and to enter
into an alliance with him; but they requested him not
to invade their land with his forces. He therefore commanded
them to submit to the authority of Calas, the
viceroy of Phrygia. Marching thence into Cappadocia,
he subjugated all that part of it which lies on this side of
the river Halys,<a name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">215</a> and much of that which lies beyond it.
Having appointed Sabictas viceroy of Cappadocia, he
advanced to the Gates of Cilicia,<a name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">216</a> and when he arrived at
the Camp of Cyrus, who (went) with Xenophon,<a name="FNanchor_217" id="FNanchor_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">217</a> and saw
that the Gates were occupied by strong guards, he left
Parmenio there with the regiments of infantry which
were more heavily armed; and about the first watch,
taking the shield-bearing guards, the archers, and the
Agrianians, he advanced by night to the Gates, in
order to fall upon the guards when they least expected
it. However, his advance was not unobserved; but his
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>boldness served him equally well, for the guards, perceiving
that Alexander was advancing in person, deserted
their post and set off in flight. At dawn next day he
passed through the Gates with all his forces and descended
into Cilicia.<a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">218</a> Here he was informed that Arsames
had previously intended to preserve Tarsus for the
Persians; but when he heard that Alexander had already
passed through the Gates, he resolved to abandon the
city; and that the Tarsians were therefore afraid he
would turn to plunder their city and afterwards evacuate
it. Hearing this, Alexander led his cavalry and the
lightest of his light infantry to Tarsus with a forced
march; consequently Arsames, hearing of his start, fled
with speed from Tarsus to King Darius without inflicting
any injury upon the city.</p>

<p>Alexander now fell ill from the toils he had undergone,
according to the account of Aristobulus; but other
authors say that while he was very hot and in profuse
perspiration he leaped into the river Cydnus<a name="FNanchor_219" id="FNanchor_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">219</a> and swam,
being eager to bathe in its water. This river flows
through the midst of the city; and as its source is in
mount Taurus and it flows through a clean district, it is
cold and its water is clear. Alexander therefore was
seized with convulsions, accompanied with high fever
and continuous sleeplessness. None of the physicians
thought he was likely to survive,<a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">220</a> except Philip, an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>Acarnanian, a physician in attendance on the king, and
very much trusted by him in medical matters, who also
enjoyed a great reputation in the army in general
affairs. This man wished to administer a purgative
draught to Alexander, and the king ordered him to
administer it. While Philip was preparing the cup, a
letter was given to the king from Parmenio, warning
him to beware of Philip; for he heard that the physician
had been bribed by Darius to poison Alexander with
medicine. But he, having read the letter, and still
holding it in his hand, took the cup which contained
the medicine and gave Philip the letter to read. While
Philip was reading the news from Parmenio, Alexander
drank the potion. It was at once evident to the king
that the physician was acting honourably in giving the
medicine, for he was not alarmed at the letter, but only
so much the more exhorted the king to obey all the other
prescriptions which he might give, promising that his
life would be saved if he obeyed his instructions. Alexander
was purged by the draught, and his illness then
took a favourable turn. He afterwards proved to Philip
that he was a faithful friend to him; and to the rest of
those about he proved that he had perfect confidence in
his friends by refusing to entertain any suspicion of their
fidelity; and at the same time he showed that he could
meet death with dauntless courage.<a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">221</a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Alexander at the Tomb of Sardanapalus.&mdash;Proceedings
in Cilicia.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">After</span> this he sent Parmenio to the other Gates which
separate the land of the Cilicians from that of the Assyrians,
in order to capture them before the enemy could
do so, and to guard the pass.<a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">222</a> He gave him the allied
infantry, the Grecian mercenaries, the Thracians who
were under the command of Sitalces, and the Thessalian
cavalry. He afterwards marched from Tarsus, and on
the first day arrived at the city of Anchialus.<a name="FNanchor_223" id="FNanchor_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">223</a> According
to report, this city was founded by Sardanapalus the
Assyrian;<a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">224</a> and both from the circumference and from
the foundations of the walls it is evident that a large
city had been founded and that it had reached a great
pitch of power. Also near the wall of Anchialus was the
monument of Sardanapalus, upon the top of which stood
the statue of that king with the hands joined to each
other just as they are joined for clapping.<a name="FNanchor_225" id="FNanchor_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">225</a> An inscription
had been placed upon it in Assyrian characters,<a name="FNanchor_226" id="FNanchor_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">226</a>
which the Assyrians asserted to be in metre. The meaning
which the words expressed was this:&mdash;“Sardanapalus,
son of Anacyndaraxas, built Anchialus and Tarsus
in one day; but do thou, O stranger, eat, drink, and
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>play, since all other human things are not worth this!”
referring, as in a riddle, to the empty sound which the
hands make in clapping. It was also said that the word
translated <i>play</i> had been expressed by a more lewd one
in the Assyrian language.</p>

<p>From Anchialus Alexander went to Soli,<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">227</a> into which
city he introduced a garrison, and imposed upon the
inhabitants a fine of 200 talents of silver,<a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">228</a> because they
were more inclined to favour the Persians than himself.
Then, having taken three regiments of Macedonian infantry,
all the archers, and the Agrianians, he marched
away thence against the Cilicians, who were holding the
mountains; and in seven days in all, having expelled
some by force, and having brought the rest over by
composition, he marched back to Soli. Here he ascertained
that Ptolemy and Asander<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">229</a> had gained the mastery
over Orontobates the Persian who was guarding the
citadel of Halicarnassus, and was also holding Myndus,
Caunus, Thera, and Callipolis.<a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">230</a> Cos and Triopium<a name="FNanchor_231" id="FNanchor_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">231</a> also
had been brought into subjection. They wrote to inform
him that Orontobates had been worsted in a great battle;
that about 700 of his infantry and 50 of his cavalry had
been killed, and not less than 1,000 taken prisoners. In
Soli Alexander offered sacrifice to Asclepius,<a name="FNanchor_232" id="FNanchor_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">232</a> conducting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>a procession of the entire army, celebrating a torch race,
and superintending a gymnastic and musical contest. He
granted the Solians the privilege of a democratical constitution;
and then marched away to Tarsus, despatching
the cavalry under Philotas to march through the Aleian
plain to the river Pyramus.<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">233</a> But he himself with the
infantry and the royal squadron of cavalry came to
Magarsus, where he offered sacrifice to the Magarsian
Athena. Thence he marched to Mallus, where he
rendered to Amphilochus the sacrificial honours due to
a hero.<a name="FNanchor_234" id="FNanchor_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">234</a> He also arrested those who were creating a
sedition among the citizens, and thus put a stop to it.
He remitted the tribute which they were paying to King
Darius, because the Malliotes were a colony of the Argives,
and he himself claimed to have sprung from Argos,
being a descendant of Heracles.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Alexander Advances to Myriandrus.&mdash;Darius
Marches against him.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">While</span> he was still at Mallus, he was informed that Darius
was encamped with all his forces at Sochi, a place in the
land of Assyria, distant about two days’ march from the
Assyrian Gates.<a name="FNanchor_235" id="FNanchor_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">235</a> Then indeed he collected the Companions
and told them what was reported about Darius
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>and his army. They urged him to lead them on as they
were, without delay. At that time he commended them,
and broke up the conference; but next day he led them
forward against Darius and the Persians. On the second
day he passed through the Gates and encamped near the
city of Myriandrus;<a name="FNanchor_236" id="FNanchor_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">236</a> but in the night a heavy tempest
and a violent storm of wind and rain occurred which
detained him in his camp. Darius, on the other hand,
had been spending a long time with his army, having
chosen a plain in the land of Assyria which stretches
out in every direction, suitable for the immense size of
his army and convenient for the evolutions of cavalry.
Amyntas, son of Antiochus, the deserter from Alexander,
advised him not to abandon this position, because there
was plenty of room for the great multitude of the Persians
and for the vast quantity of their baggage. So Darius
remained. But as Alexander made a long stay at Tarsus
on account of his illness, and not a short one at Soli,
where he offered sacrifice and conducted his army in
procession, and moreover spent some time in marching
against the Cilician mountaineers, Darius was induced
to swerve from his resolution. He was also not unwilling
to be led to form whatever decision was most agreeable
to his own wishes; and being influenced by those who
gave him the advice which they thought would be pleasant
to him, without consideration of its utility (for kings will
always have associates to give them bad advice),<a name="FNanchor_237" id="FNanchor_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">237</a> he came
to the conclusion that Alexander was no longer desirous
of advancing further, but was shrinking from an encounter
on learning that Darius himself was marching against
him. On all sides they were urging him on, asserting
that he would trample down the army of the Macedonians
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>with his cavalry.<a name="FNanchor_238" id="FNanchor_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">238</a> Nevertheless, Amyntas, at any rate,
confidently affirmed that Alexander would certainly come
to any place where he heard Darius might be; and he exhorted
him by all means to stay where he was. But the
worse advice, because at the immediate time it was more
pleasant to hear, prevailed; moreover he was led by some
divine influence into that locality where he derived little
advantage from his cavalry and from the sheer number
of his men, javelins and bows, and where he could not even
exhibit the mere magnificence of his army, but surrendered
to Alexander and his troops an easy victory. For
it was already decreed by fate that the Persians should
be deprived of the rule of Asia by the Macedonians, just
as the Medes had been deprived of it by the Persians,
and still earlier the Assyrians by the Medes.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER VII.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Darius at Issus.&mdash;Alexander’s Speech to his Army.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Darius</span> crossed the mountain range by what are called the
Amanic Gates, and advancing towards Issus, came without
being noticed to the rear of Alexander.<a name="FNanchor_239" id="FNanchor_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">239</a> Having reached
Issus, he captured as many of the Macedonians as had
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>been left behind there on account of illness. These he
cruelly mutilated and slew. Next day he proceeded to the
river Pinarus. As soon as Alexander heard that Darius
was in his rear, because the news did not seem to him trustworthy,
he embarked some of the Companions in a ship
with thirty oars, and sent them back to Issus, to observe
whether the report was true.. The men who sailed in the
thirty-oared ship discovered the Persians encamped there
more easily, because the sea in this part takes the form
of a bay. They therefore brought back word to Alexander
that Darius was at hand. Alexander then called together
the generals, the commanders of cavalry, and the leaders
of the Grecian allies, and exhorted them to take courage
from the dangers which they had already surmounted,
asserting that the struggle would be between themselves
who had been previously victorious and a foe who had
already been beaten; and that the deity was acting the
part of general on their behalf better than himself, by
putting it into the mind of Darius to move his forces
from the spacious plain and shut them up in a narrow
place, where there was sufficient room for them to deepen
their phalanx by marching from front to rear, but where
their vast multitude would be useless to their enemy in
battle. He added that their foes were similar to them
neither in strength nor in courage; for the Macedonians,
who had long been practised in warlike toils accompanied
with danger, were coming into close conflict with Persians
and Medes, men who had become enervated by a long
course of luxurious ease; and, to crown all, they, being
freemen, were about to engage in battle with men who
were slaves. He said, moreover, that the Greeks who
were in the two armies would not be fighting for the
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>same objects; for those with Darius were braving danger
for pay, and that pay not high; whereas, those on their
side were voluntarily defending the interests of Greece.
Again, of foreigners, the Thracians, Paeonians, Illyrians,
and Agrianians, who were the most robust and warlike
of men in Europe, were about to be arrayed against the
most sluggish and effeminate races of Asia. In addition
to all this, Alexander was commanding in the field against
Darius. These things he enumerated as evidences of
their superiority in the struggle; and then he began to
point out the great rewards they would win from the
danger to be incurred. For he told them that on that
occasion they would overcome, not merely the viceroys of
Darius, nor the cavalry drawn up at the Granicus, nor
the 20,000 Grecian mercenaries, but would overcome all
the available forces of the Persians and Medes, as well
as all the other races subject to them dwelling in Asia,
and the Great King present in person. After this conflict
nothing would be left for them to do, except to take
possession of all Asia, and to put an end to their many
labours. In addition to this, he reminded them of their
brilliant achievements in their collective capacity in
days gone by; and if any man had individually performed
any distinguished feat of valour from love of glory, he
mentioned him by name in commendation of the deed.<a name="FNanchor_240" id="FNanchor_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">240</a>
He then recapitulated as modestly as possible his own
daring deeds in the various battles. He is also said to
have reminded them of Xenophon and the ten thousand
men who accompanied him, asserting that the latter were
in no way comparable with them either in number or in
general excellence. Besides, they had had with them
neither Thessalian, Bœotian, Peloponnesian, Macedonian,
or Thracian horsemen, nor any of the other cavalry which
was in the Macedonian army; nor had they any archers
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>or slingers except a few Cretans and Rhodians, and even
these were got ready by Xenophon on the spur of the
moment in the very crisis of danger.<a name="FNanchor_241" id="FNanchor_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">241</a> And yet even
these put the king and all his forces to rout close to
Babylon<a name="FNanchor_242" id="FNanchor_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">242</a> itself, and succeeded in reaching the Euxine
Sea after defeating all the races which lay in their way
as they were marching down thither. He also adduced
whatever other arguments were suitable for a great
commander to use in order to encourage brave men in
such a critical moment before the perils of battle. They
urged him to lead them against the foe without delay,
coming from all sides to grasp the king’s right hand,
and encouraging him by their promises.</p>

<hr />

<h3>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Arrangement of the Hostile Armies.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Alexander</span> then ordered his soldiers to take their dinner,
and having sent a few of his horsemen and archers
forward to the Gates to reconnoitre the road in the rear,
he took the whole of his army and marched in the night
to occupy the pass again. When about midnight he had
again got possession of it, he caused the army to rest the
remainder of the night there upon the rocks, having
posted vigilant sentries. At the approach of dawn he
began to descend from the pass along the road; and as
long as the space was narrow everywhere, he led his
army in column, but when the mountains parted so as to
leave a plain between them, he kept on opening out the
column into the phalanx, marching one line of heavy
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>armed infantry after another up into line towards the
mountain on the right and towards the sea on the left.
Up to this time his cavalry had been ranged behind the
infantry; but when they advanced into the open country,
he began to draw up his army in order of battle. First,
upon the right wing near the mountain he placed his
infantry guard and the shield-bearers, under the command
of Nicanor, son of Parmenio; next to these the
regiment of Coenus, and close to them that of Perdiccas.
These troops were posted as far as the middle of the
heavy-armed infantry to one beginning from the right.
On the left wing first stood the regiment of Amyntas,
then that of Ptolemy, and close to this that of Meleager.
The infantry on the left had been placed under the command
of Craterus; but Parmenio held the chief direction
of the whole left wing. This general had been ordered
not to abandon the sea, so that they might not be surrounded
by the foreigners, who were likely to outflank
them on all sides by their superior numbers.<a name="FNanchor_243" id="FNanchor_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">243</a></p>

<p>But as soon as Darius was certified of Alexander’s
approach for battle, he conveyed about 30,000 of his
cavalry and with them 20,000 of his light-armed infantry
across the river Pinarus, in order that he might be able
to draw up the rest of his forces with ease. Of the heavy
armed infantry, he placed first the 30,000 Greek mercenaries
to oppose the phalanx of the Macedonians, and
on both sides of these he placed 60,000 of the men called
Cardaces,<a name="FNanchor_244" id="FNanchor_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">244</a> who were also heavy-armed infantry.<a name="FNanchor_245" id="FNanchor_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">245</a> For
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>the place where they were posted was able to contain
only this number in a single phalanx.<a name="FNanchor_246" id="FNanchor_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">246</a> He also posted
20,000 men near the mountain on their left and facing
Alexander’s right. Some of these troops were also in
the rear of Alexander’s army; for the mountain near
which they were posted in one part sloped a great way
back and formed a sort of bay, like a bay in the sea, and
afterwards bending forwards caused the men who had
been posted at the foot of it to be behind Alexander’s
right wing. The remaining multitude of Darius’s light-armed
and heavy-armed infantry was marshalled by
nations to an unserviceable depth and placed behind the
Grecian mercenaries and the Persian army arranged in
phalanx. The whole of the army with Darius was said
to number about 600,000 fighting men.<a name="FNanchor_247" id="FNanchor_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">247</a></p>

<p>As Alexander advanced, he found that the ground
spread out a little in breadth, and he accordingly brought
up his horsemen, both those called Companions, and the
Thessalians as well as the Macedonians, and posted them
with himself on the right wing. The Peloponnesians
and the rest of the allied force of Greeks he sent to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>Parmenio on the left. When Darius had marshalled
his phalanx, by a pre-concerted signal he recalled the
cavalry which he had posted in front of the river for the
express purpose of rendering the arranging of his army
easy. Most of these he placed on the right wing near
the sea facing Parmenio; because here the ground was
more suitable for the evolutions of cavalry. A certain
part of them also he led up to the mountain towards the
left. But when they were seen to be useless there on
account of the narrowness of the ground, he ordered most
of these also to ride round to the right wing and join
their comrades there. Darius himself occupied the centre
of the whole army, inasmuch as it was the custom for the
kings of Persia to take up that position, the reason of
which arrangement has been recorded by Xenophon, son
of Gryllus.<a name="FNanchor_248" id="FNanchor_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">248</a></p>

<hr />

<h3>CHAPTER IX.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Alexander Changes the Disposition of his Forces.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Meantime</span> when Alexander perceived that nearly all the
Persian cavalry had changed their ground and gone to
his left towards the sea, and that on his side only the
Peloponnesians and the rest of the Grecian cavalry were
posted there, he sent the Thessalian cavalry thither with
speed, ordering them not to ride along before the front
of the whole array, lest they should be seen by the
enemy to be shifting their ground, but to proceed by
stealth in the rear of the phalanx.<a name="FNanchor_249" id="FNanchor_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">249</a> In front of the
cavalry on the right, he posted the lancers under the
command of Protomachus, and the Paeonians under that
of Aristo; and of the infantry, the archers under the
direction of Antiochus, and the Agrianians under that of
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>Attalus. Some of the cavalry and archers also he drew
up so as to form an angle with the centre<a name="FNanchor_250" id="FNanchor_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">250</a> towards the
mountain which was in the rear; so on the right his
phalanx had been drawn up separated into two wings,
the one fronting Darius and the main body of Persians
beyond the river, and the other facing those who had
been posted at the mountain in their rear. On the left
wing the infantry consisting of the Cretan archers and
the Thracians under command of Sitalces were posted
in front; and before these the cavalry towards the left.
The Grecian mercenaries were drawn up as a reserve for
all of them. When he perceived that the phalanx towards
the right was too thin, and it seemed likely that
the Persians would outflank him here considerably, he
ordered two squadrons of the Companion cavalry, viz. the
Anthemusian,<a name="FNanchor_251" id="FNanchor_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">251</a> of which Peroedas, son of Menestheus, was
captain, and that which was called Leugaean, under the
command of Pantordanus, son of Cleander, to proceed
from the centre to the right without being seen. Having
also marched the archers, part of the Agrianians and of
the Grecian mercenaries up along his right in the front,
he extended his phalanx beyond the wing of the Persians.
But when those who had been posted upon the mountain
did not descend, a charge was made by a few of the
Agrianians and archers at Alexander’s order, by which
they were easily put to the rout from the foot of the
mountain. As they fled to the summit he decided that
he could make use of the men who had been drawn up to
keep these in check, to fill up the ranks of his phalanx.
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>He thought it quite sufficient to post 300 horsemen to
watch the men on the mountain.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER X.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Battle of Issus.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Having</span> thus marshalled his men, he caused them to rest
for some time, and then led them forward, as he thought
the enemy’s approach was very slow. For Darius was
no longer leading the foreigners against him, as he had
arranged them at first, but he remained in his position,
upon the bank of the river, which was in many parts steep
and precipitous; and in certain places, where it seemed
more easy to ascend, he extended a stockade along it. By
this it was at once evident to Alexander’s men that
Darius had become cowed in spirit.<a name="FNanchor_252" id="FNanchor_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">252</a> But when the
armies at length met in conflict, Alexander rode about in
every direction to exhort his troops to show their valour;
mentioning with befitting epithets the names, not only of
the generals, but also those of the captains of cavalry and
infantry, and of the Grecian mercenaries as many as were
more distinguished either by rank or merit. From all
sides arose a shout not to delay but to attack the enemy.
At first he still led them on in close array with measured
step, although he had the forces of Darius already in full
view, lest by a more hasty march any part of the phalanx
should fluctuate from the line<a name="FNanchor_253" id="FNanchor_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">253</a> and get separated from
the rest. But when they came within range of darts,
Alexander himself and those around him being posted on
the right wing, advanced first into the river with a run,
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>in order to alarm the Persians by the rapidity of their onset,
and by coming sooner to close conflict to receive little
damage from the archers. And it turned out just as Alexander
had conjectured; for as soon as the battle became
a hand-to-hand one, the part of the Persian army stationed
on the left wing was put to rout; and here Alexander
and his men won a brilliant victory. But the Grecian
mercenaries serving under Darius attacked the Macedonians
at the point where they saw their phalanx
especially disordered. For the Macedonian phalanx had
been broken and disjoined towards the right wing;
because Alexander had charged into the river with eagerness,
and engaging in a hand-to-hand conflict was already
driving back the Persians posted there; but the Macedonians
in the centre did not execute their task with equal
speed; and finding many parts of the bank steep and
precipitous, they were unable to preserve the front of the
phalanx in the same line. Here then the struggle was
desperate; the aim of the Grecian mercenaries of Darius
being to push the Macedonians back into the river, and
regain the victory, though their own forces were already
flying; the aim of the Macedonians being not to fall
short of Alexander’s good-fortune, which was already
manifest, and not to tarnish the glory of the phalanx,
which up to that time had been commonly asserted to be
invincible. Moreover the feeling of rivalry which existed
between the Grecian and Macedonian races inspired each
side in the conflict. Here fell Ptolemy, son of Seleucus,
after proving himself a valiant man, besides about one
hundred and twenty other Macedonians of no mean
repute.<a name="FNanchor_254" id="FNanchor_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">254</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XI.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Defeat and Flight of Darius.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Hereupon</span> the regiments on the right wing, perceiving
that the Persians opposed to them had already been put
to rout, wheeled round towards the Grecian mercenaries
of Darius and their own hard-pressed detachment. Having
driven the Greeks away from the river, they extended
their phalanx beyond the Persian army on the side which
had been broken; and attacking the Greeks on the flank,
were already beginning to cut them up. However the
Persian cavalry which had been posted opposite the
Thessalians did not remain on the other side of the river
during the struggle, but came through the water and
made a vigorous attack upon the Thessalian squadrons.<a name="FNanchor_255" id="FNanchor_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">255</a>
In this place a fierce cavalry battle ensued; for the Persians
did not give way until they perceived that Darius
had fled and the Grecian mercenaries had been cut up by
the phalanx and severed from them. Then at last the
flight of all the Persians was plainly visible. Their
horses suffered much injury in the retreat, because the
riders<a name="FNanchor_256" id="FNanchor_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">256</a> were heavily armed; and the horsemen themselves,
being so many in number and retreating in panic terror
without any regard to order along narrow roads, were
trampled on and injured no less by each other than by the
pursuing enemy. The Thessalians also followed them up
with vigour, so that no fewer of the cavalry than of the
infantry<a name="FNanchor_257" id="FNanchor_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">257</a> were slaughtered in the flight.</p>

<p>But as soon as the left wing of Darius was terrified and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>routed by Alexander, and the Persian king perceived that
this part of his army was severed from the rest, without
any further delay he began to flee in his chariot along
with the first, just as he was.<a name="FNanchor_258" id="FNanchor_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">258</a> He was conveyed safely
in the chariot as long as he met with level ground in his
flight; but when he lighted upon ravines and other rough
ground, he left the chariot there, divesting himself of his
shield and Median mantle. He even left his bow in the
chariot; and mounting a horse continued his flight. The
night, which came on soon after, alone rescued him from
being captured by Alexander;<a name="FNanchor_259" id="FNanchor_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">259</a> for as long as there was
daylight the latter kept up the pursuit at full speed. But
when it began to grow dark and the ground before the
feet became invisible, he turned back again to the camp,
after capturing the chariot of Darius with the shield, the
Median mantle, and the bow in it.<a name="FNanchor_260" id="FNanchor_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">260</a> For his pursuit had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>been too slow for him to overtake Darius, because, though
he wheeled round at the first breaking asunder of the
phalanx, yet he did not turn to pursue him until he
observed that the Grecian mercenaries and the Persian
cavalry had been driven away from the river.</p>

<p>Of the Persians were killed Arsames, Rheomithres, and
Atizyes who had commanded the cavalry at the Granicus.
Sabaces, viceroy of Egypt, and Bubaces, one of the Persian
dignitaries, were also killed, besides about 100,000 of the
private soldiers, among them being more than 10,000
cavalry.<a name="FNanchor_261" id="FNanchor_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">261</a> So great was the slaughter that Ptolemy, son
of Lagus, who then accompanied Alexander, says that the
men who were with them pursuing Darius, coming in the
pursuit to a ravine, filled it up with the corpses and so
passed over it. The camp of Darius was taken forthwith
at the first assault, containing his mother, his wife,&mdash;who
was also his sister,&mdash;and his infant son.<a name="FNanchor_262" id="FNanchor_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">262</a> His two
daughters, and a few other women, wives of Persian
peers,<a name="FNanchor_263" id="FNanchor_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">263</a> who were in attendance upon them, were likewise
captured. For the other Persians happened to have
despatched their women along with the rest of their
property to Damascus;<a name="FNanchor_264" id="FNanchor_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">264</a> because Darius had sent to that
city the greater part of his money and all the other things
which the Great King was in the habit of taking with him
as necessary for his luxurious mode of living, even though
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>he was going on a military expedition. The consequence
was, that in the camp no more than 3,000 talents<a name="FNanchor_265" id="FNanchor_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">265</a> were
captured; and soon after, the money in Damascus was
also seized by Parmenio, who was despatched thither for
that very purpose. Such was the result of this famous
battle (which was fought) in the month Maimacterion,
when Nicostratus was archon of the Athenians.<a name="FNanchor_266" id="FNanchor_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">266</a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XII.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Kind Treatment of Darius’s Family.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">The</span> next day, Alexander, though suffering from a wound
which he had received in the thigh from a sword, visited
the wounded, and having collected the bodies of the slain,
he gave them a splendid burial with all his forces most
brilliantly marshalled in order of battle. He also spoke
with eulogy to those whom he himself had recognised
performing any gallant deed in the battle, and also to
those whose exploits he had learnt by report fully corroborated.
He likewise honoured each of them individually
with a gift of money in proportion to his desert.<a name="FNanchor_267" id="FNanchor_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">267</a> He
then appointed Balacrus, son of Nicanor, one of the royal
body-guards, viceroy of Cilicia; and in his place among
the body-guards he chose Menes, son of Dionysius. In
the room of Ptolemy, son of Seleucus, who had been
killed in the battle, he appointed Polysperchon, son of
Simmias, to the command of a brigade. He remitted to
the Solians the fifty talents<a name="FNanchor_268" id="FNanchor_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">268</a> which were still due of the
money imposed on them as a fine, and he gave them back
their hostages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span></p>

<p>Nor did he treat the mother, wife, and children of
Darius with neglect; for some of those who have written
Alexander’s history say that on the very night in which
he returned from the pursuit of Darius, entering the
Persian king’s tent, which had been selected for his use,
he heard the lamentation of women and other noise of a
similar kind not far from the tent. Inquiring therefore
who the women were, and why they were in a tent so near,
he was answered by some one as follows:&mdash;“O king, the
mother, wife, and children of Darius are lamenting for him
as slain, since they have been informed that thou hast his
bow and his royal mantle, and that his shield has been
brought back.” When Alexander heard this, be sent
Leonnatus,<a name="FNanchor_269" id="FNanchor_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">269</a> one of his Companions, to them, with injunctions
to tell them:&mdash;“Darius is still alive; in his flight
he left his arms and mantle in the chariot; and these are
the only things of his that Alexander has.” Leonnatus
entered the tent and told them the news about Darius,
saying, moreover, that Alexander would allow them to
retain the state and retinue befitting their royal rank, as
well as the title of queens; for he had not undertaken
the war against Darius from a feeling of hatred, but he
had conducted it in a legitimate manner for the empire
of Asia. Such are the statements of Ptolemy and Aristobulus.<a name="FNanchor_270" id="FNanchor_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">270</a>
But there is another report, to the effect that
on the following day Alexander himself went into the
tent, accompanied alone by Hephaestion, one of his Companions.
The mother of Darius,<a name="FNanchor_271" id="FNanchor_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">271</a> being in doubt which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>of them was the king (for they had both arrayed themselves
in the same style of dress), went up to Hephaestion,
because he appeared to her the taller of the two,
and prostrated herself before him. But when he drew
back, and one of her attendants pointed out Alexander,
saying he was the king, she was ashamed of her mistake,
and was going to retire. But the king told her she had
made no mistake, for Hephaestion was also an Alexander.
This I record neither being sure of its truth nor thinking
it altogether unreliable. If it really occurred, I commend
Alexander for his compassionate treatment of the women,
and the confidence he felt in his companion, and the
honour bestowed on him; but if it merely seems probable
to historians that Alexander would have acted
and spoken thus, even for this reason I think him worthy
of commendation.<a name="FNanchor_272" id="FNanchor_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">272</a></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Darius</span> fled through the night with a few attendants; but
in the daytime, picking up as he went along the Persians
and Grecian mercenaries who had come safely out of
the battle, he had in all 4,000 men under his command.
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>He then made a forced march towards the city of Thapsacus<a name="FNanchor_273" id="FNanchor_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">273</a>
and the river Euphrates,<a name="FNanchor_274" id="FNanchor_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">274</a> in order to put that

But Amyntas son of Antiochus, Thymondas son
of Mentor, Aristomedes the Pheraean, and Bianor the
Acarnanian, all being deserters, fled without delay from
the posts assigned them in the battle, with about 8,000
soldiers under their command, and passing through the
mountains, they arrived at Tripolis in Phoenicia.<a name="FNanchor_275" id="FNanchor_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">275</a> There
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>they seized the ships which had been hauled up on shore
in which they had previously been transported from
Lesbos; they launched as many of these vessel as they
thought sufficient to convey them, and the rest they burnt
there in the docks, in order not to supply their enemy
with the means of quickly pursuing them. They fled<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
first to Cyprus,<a name="FNanchor_276" id="FNanchor_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">276</a> thence to Egypt; where Amyntas
shortly after, meddling in political disputes, was killed by
the natives.</p>

<p>Meantime Pharnabazus and Autophradates were staying
near Chios; then having established a garrison in this
island they despatched some of their ships to Cos and
Halicarnassus, and with 100 of their best sailing vessels
they put to sea themselves and landed at Siphnus. And
Agis, king of the Lacedaemonians,<a name="FNanchor_277" id="FNanchor_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">277</a> came to them with
one trireme, both to ask for money to carry on the war,
and also to urge them to send with him into the Peloponnese
as large a force both naval and military as they
could. At that very time news reached them of the
battle which had been fought at Issus; and being
alarmed at the report, Pharnabazus started off to Chios
with twelve triremes and 1,500 Grecian mercenaries, for
fear that the Chians might attempt to effect a revolution
when they received the news of the Persian defeat. Agis,
having received from Autophradates thirty talents of
silver<a name="FNanchor_278" id="FNanchor_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">278</a> and ten triremes, despatched Hippias to lead these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>ships to his brother Agesilaus at Taenarum,<a name="FNanchor_279" id="FNanchor_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">279</a> ordering him
also to instruct Agesilaus to give full pay to the sailors
and then to sail as quickly as possible to Crete,<a name="FNanchor_280" id="FNanchor_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">280</a> in order
to set things in order there. For a time he himself remained
there among the islands, but afterwards joined
Autophradates at Halicarnassus.<a name="FNanchor_281" id="FNanchor_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">281</a></p>

<p>Alexander appointed Menon, son of Cerdimmas, viceroy
of Coele-Syria,<a name="FNanchor_282" id="FNanchor_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">282</a> giving him the cavalry of the Grecian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>allies to guard the country. He then went in person
towards Phoenicia; and on the march he was met by
Strato, son of Gerostratus, king of the Aradians and of
the people living near Aradus.<a name="FNanchor_283" id="FNanchor_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">283</a> But Gerostratus himself
was serving in the fleet with Autophradates, as were
also the other kings both of the Phoenicians and the
Cyprians. When Strato fell in with Alexander, he placed
a golden crown upon his head, promising to surrender to
him both the island of Aradus and the great and prosperous
city of Marathus, situated on the mainland right
opposite Aradus; also Sigon, the city of Mariamme, and
all the other places under his own dominion and that of
his father.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIV.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Darius’s Letter, and Alexander’s Reply.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">While</span> Alexander was still in Marathus, ambassadors
came bringing a letter from Darius, entreating him to
give up to their king his mother, wife, and children.
They were also instructed to support this petition by
word of mouth. The letter pointed out to him that
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>friendship and alliance had subsisted between Philip and
Artaxerxes;<a name="FNanchor_284" id="FNanchor_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">284</a> and that when Arses, son of Artaxerxes,
ascended the throne, Philip was the first to practise injustice
towards him, though he had suffered no injury
from the Persians. Alexander also, from the time when
Darius began to reign over the Persians, had not sent
any one to him to confirm the friendship and alliance
which had so long existed, but had crossed over into
Asia with his army and had inflicted much injury upon
the Persians. For this reason he had come down in
person, to defend his country and to preserve the empire
of his fathers. As to the battle, it had been decided as
seemed good to some one of the gods. And now he,
a king, begged his captured wife, mother, and children
from a king; and he wished to form a friendship with
him and become his ally. For this purpose he requested
Alexander to send men to him with Meniscus and Arsimas,
the messengers who came from the Persians, to receive
pledges of fidelity from him and to give them on behalf
of Alexander.</p>

<p>To this Alexander wrote a reply, and sent Thersippus
with the men who had come from Darius, with instructions
to give the letter to Darius, but not to converse
about anything. Alexander’s letter ran thus: “Your
ancestors came into Macedonia and the rest of Greece
and treated us ill, without any previous injury from us. I,
having been appointed commander-in-chief of the Greeks,
and wishing to take revenge on the Persians, crossed
over into Asia, hostilities being begun by you. For
you sent aid to the Perinthians,<a name="FNanchor_285" id="FNanchor_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">285</a> who were dealing unjustly
with my father; and Ochus sent forces into Thrace,
which was under our rule. My father was killed by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>conspirators whom you instigated, as you have yourself
boasted to all in your letters;<a name="FNanchor_286" id="FNanchor_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">286</a> and after slaying Arses,
as well as Bagoas, and unjustly seizing the throne contrary to
the law of the Persians,<a name="FNanchor_287" id="FNanchor_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">287</a> and ruling your subjects
unjustly, you sent unfriendly letters about me to the
Greeks, urging them to wage war with me. You have
also despatched money to the Lacedaemonians, and certain
other Greeks; but none of the States received it,
except the Lacedaemonians.<a name="FNanchor_288" id="FNanchor_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">288</a> As your agents destroyed
my friends, and were striving to dissolve the league which
I had formed among the Greeks, I took the field against
you, because you were the party who commenced the
hostility. Since I have vanquished your generals and
viceroys in the previous battle, and now yourself and
your forces in like manner, I am, by the gift of the gods, in
possession of your land. As many of the men who fought
in your army as were not killed in the battle, but fled to
me for refuge, I am protecting; and they are with me, not
against their own will, but they are serving in my army
as volunteers. Come to me therefore, since I am lord of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>all Asia; but if you are afraid you may suffer any harsh
treatment from me in case you come to me, send some of
your friends to receive pledges of safety from me. Come
to me then, and ask for your mother, wife, and children,
and anything else you wish. For whatever you ask for
you will receive; and nothing shall be denied you. But
for the future, whenever you send to me, send to me as
the king of Asia, and do not address to me your wishes
as to an equal; but if you are in need of anything, speak
to me as to the man who is lord of all your territories. If
you act otherwise, I shall deliberate concerning you as
an evil-doer; and if you dispute my right to the kingdom,
stay and fight another battle for it; but do not run
away. For wherever you may be, I intend to march
against you.” This is the letter which he sent to Darius.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Alexander’s Treatment of the Captured Greek Ambassadors.&mdash;Submission

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">When</span> Alexander ascertained that all the money which
Darius had sent off to Damascus with Cophen, son of
Artabazus, was captured, and also that the Persians who
had been left in charge of it, as well as the rest of the
royal property, were taken prisoners, he ordered Parmenio
to take the treasure back to Damascus, and there
guard it.<a name="FNanchor_289" id="FNanchor_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">289</a> When he also ascertained that the Grecian
ambassadors who had reached Darius before the battle
had likewise been captured, he ordered them to be sent
to him.<a name="FNanchor_290" id="FNanchor_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">290</a> They were Euthycles, a Spartan; Thessaliscus,
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>son of Ismenias, and Dionysodorus, a victor in the
Olympic games, Thebans; and Iphicrates, son of Iphicrates
the general, an Athenian.<a name="FNanchor_291" id="FNanchor_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">291</a> When these men came
to Alexander, he immediately released Thessaliscus and
Dionysodorus, though they were Thebans, partly out of
compassion for Thebes, and partly because they seemed
to have acted in a pardonable manner. For their native
city had been reduced to slavery by the Macedonians,
and they were trying to find whatever succour they could
for themselves and perhaps also for their native city from
Darius and the Persians. Thinking thus compassionately
about both of them, he released them, saying that he
dismissed Thessaliscus individually out of respect for his
pedigree, for he belonged to the ranks of the distinguished
men of Thebes. Dionysodorus also he released because
he had been conqueror at the Olympic games; and he
kept Iphricrates in attendance on himself as long as he
lived, treating him with special honour both from friendship
to the city of Athens and from recollection of his
father’s glory. When he died soon after from sickness,
he sent his bones back to his relations at Athens. But
Euthycles at first he kept in custody, though without
fetters, both because he was a Lacedaemonian of a city
at that time openly and eminently hostile to him, and
because in the man as an individual he could find nothing
to warrant his pardon. Afterwards, when he met with
great success, he released even this man also.</p>

<p>He set out from Marathus and took possession of
Byblus<a name="FNanchor_292" id="FNanchor_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">292</a> on terms of capitulation, as he did also of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>Sidon,<a name="FNanchor_293" id="FNanchor_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">293</a> the inhabitants of which spontaneously invited
him from hatred of the Persians and Darius.<a name="FNanchor_294" id="FNanchor_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">294</a> Thence
he advanced towards Tyre;<a name="FNanchor_295" id="FNanchor_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">295</a> ambassadors from which city,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>despatched by the commonwealth, met him on the march,
announcing that the Tyrians had decided to do whatever
be might command.<a name="FNanchor_296" id="FNanchor_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">296</a> He commended both the city and
its ambassadors, and ordered them to return and tell the
Tyrians that he wished to enter their city and offer sacrifice
to Heracles. The son of the king of the Tyrians was
one of the ambassadors, and the others were conspicuous
men in Tyre; but the king Azemilcus<a name="FNanchor_297" id="FNanchor_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">297</a> himself was sailing
with Autophradates.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER XVI.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Worship of Hercules in Tyre.&mdash;The Tyrians
Refuse to Admit Alexander.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">The</span> reason of this demand was, that in Tyre there existed
a temple of Heracles,<a name="FNanchor_298" id="FNanchor_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">298</a> the most ancient of all those which
are mentioned in history. It was not dedicated to the
Argive Heracles, the son of Alcmena; for this Heracles
was honoured in Tyre many generations before Cadmus
set out from Phoenicia and occupied Thebes, and before
Semele, the daughter of Cadmus, was born, from whom
Dionysus, the son of Zeus, was born. This Dionysus
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>would be third from Cadmus, being a contemporary of
Labdacus, son of Polydorus, the son of Cadmus; and the
Argive Heracles lived about the time of Oedipus, son of
Laius.<a name="FNanchor_299" id="FNanchor_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">299</a> The Egyptians also worshipped another Heracles,
not the one which either the Tyrians or Greeks worship.
But Herodotus says that the Egyptians considered
Heracles to be one of the twelve gods,<a name="FNanchor_300" id="FNanchor_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">300</a> just as the
Athenians worshipped a different Dionysus, who was the
son of Zeus and Core; and the mystic chant called
Iacchus was sung to this Dionysus, not to th ligaturee Theban.
So also I think that the Heracles honoured in Tartessus<a name="FNanchor_301" id="FNanchor_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">301</a>
by the Iberians, where are certain pillars named after
Heracles, is the Tyrian Heracles; for Tartessus was a
colony of the Phœnicians, and the temple to Heracles
there was built and the sacrifices offered after the usage
of the Phœnicians. Hecataeus the historian<a name="FNanchor_302" id="FNanchor_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">302</a> says Geryones,
against whom the Argive Heracles was despatched
by Eurystheus to drive his oxen away and bring them
to Mycenae, had nothing to do with the land of the
Iberians;<a name="FNanchor_303" id="FNanchor_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">303</a> nor was Heracles despatched to any island
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>called Erythia<a name="FNanchor_304" id="FNanchor_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">304</a> outside the Great Sea; but that Geryones
was king of the mainland (Epirus) around Ambracia<a name="FNanchor_305" id="FNanchor_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">305</a> and
the Amphilochians, that Heracles drove the oxen from
this Epirus, and that this was deemed no mean task. I
know that to the present time this part of the mainland is
rich in pasture land and rears a very fine breed of oxen;
and I do not think it beyond the bounds of probability that
the fame of the oxen from Epirus, and the name of the
king of Epirus, Geryones, had reached Eurystheus. But
I do not think that Eurystheus would know the name of
the king of the Iberians, who were the remotest nation
in Europe, or whether a fine breed of oxen grazed in their
land, unless some one, by introducing Hera into the account,
as herself giving these commands to Heracles
through Eurystheus, wished, by means of the fable, to
disguise the incredibility of the tale.</p>

<p>To this Tyrian Heracles, Alexander said he wished to
offer sacrifice. But when this message was brought to
Tyre by the ambassadors, the people passed a decree to
obey any other command of Alexander, but not to admit
into the city any Persian or Macedonian; thinking that
under the existing circumstances, this was the most
specious answer, and that it would be the safest course
for them to pursue in reference to the issue of the war,
which was still uncertain.<a name="FNanchor_306" id="FNanchor_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">306</a> When the answer from Tyre
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>was brought to Alexander, he sent the ambassadors back
in a rage. He then summoned a council of his Companions
and the leaders of his army, together with the
captains of infantry and cavalry, and spoke as follows:&mdash;</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER XVII.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Speech of Alexander to his Officers.</span></p>

<p>“Friends and allies, I see that an expedition to Egypt
will not be safe for us, so long as the Persians retain the
sovereignty of the sea; nor is it a safe course, both for
other reasons, and especially looking at the state of
matters in Greece, for us to pursue Darius, leaving in
our rear the city of Tyre itself in doubtful allegiance,
and Egypt and Cyprus in the occupation of the Persians.
I am apprehensive lest while we advance with our forces
towards Babylon and in pursuit of Darius, the Persians
should again forsooth conquer the maritime districts, and
transfer the war into Greece with a larger army, considering
that the Lacedaemonians are now waging war
against us without disguise, and the city of Athens is
restrained for the present rather by fear than by any
good-will towards us. But if Tyre were captured, the
whole of Phoenicia would be in our possession, and the
fleet of the Phoenicians, which is the most numerous and
the best in the Persian navy, would in all probability
come over to us. For the Phoenician sailors and marines
will not put to sea in order to incur danger on behalf of
others, when their own cities are occupied by us. After
this, Cyprus will either yield to us without delay, or will
be captured with ease at the mere arrival of a naval
force; and then navigating the sea with the ships from
Macedonia in conjunction with those of the Phoenicians,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
Cyprus at the same time coming over to us, we shall
acquire the absolute sovereignty of the sea, and at the
same time an expedition into Egypt will become an easy
matter for us. After we have brought Egypt into subjection,
no anxiety about Greece and our own land will
any longer remain, and we shall be able to undertake the
expedition to Babylon with safety in regard to affairs at
home, and at the same time with greater reputation, in
consequence of having cut off from the Persian empire
all the maritime provinces and all the land this side of
the Euphrates.”</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER XVIII.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Siege of Tyre.&mdash;Construction of a Mole from the
Mainland to the Island.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">By</span> this speech he easily persuaded his officers to make
an attempt upon Tyre. Moreover he was encouraged by
a divine admonition, for that very night in his sleep<a name="FNanchor_307" id="FNanchor_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">307</a> he
seemed to be approaching the Tyrian walls, and Heracles
seemed to take him by the right hand and lead him up
into the city. This was interpreted by Aristander<a name="FNanchor_308" id="FNanchor_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">308</a> to
mean that Tyre would be taken with labour, because the
deeds of Heracles were accomplished with labour. Certainly,
the siege of Tyre appeared to be a great enterprise;
for the city was an island<a name="FNanchor_309" id="FNanchor_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">309</a> and fortified all round
with lofty walls. Moreover naval operations seemed at
that time more favourable to the Tyrians, both because
the Persians still possessed the sovereignty of the sea
and many ships were still remaining with the citizens
themselves. However, as these arguments of his had
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>prevailed, he resolved to construct a mole from the mainland
to the city.<a name="FNanchor_310" id="FNanchor_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">310</a> The place is a narrow strait full of
pools; and the part of it near the mainland is shallow
water and muddy, but the part near the city itself, where
was the deepest part of the channel, was the depth of
about three fathoms. But there was an abundant supply
of stones and wood, which they put on the top of the
stones.<a name="FNanchor_311" id="FNanchor_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">311</a> Stakes were easily fixed down firmly in the
mud, which itself served as a cement to the stones to
hold them firm. The zeal of the Macedonians in the
work was great, and it was increased by the presence of
Alexander himself, who took the lead<a name="FNanchor_312" id="FNanchor_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">312</a> in everything,
now rousing the men to exertion by speech, and now by
presents of money, lightening the labour of those who
were toiling more than their fellows from the desire of
gaining praise for their exertions. As long as the mole
was being constructed near the mainland, the work made
easy and rapid progress, as the material was poured into a
small depth of water, and there was no one to hinder them;
but when they began to approach the deeper water, and
at the same time came near the city itself, they suffered
severely, being assailed with missiles from the walls, which
were lofty, inasmuch as they had been expressly equipped
for work rather than for fighting. Moreover, as the
Tyrians still retained command of the sea, they kept on
sailing with their triremes to various parts of the mole,
and made it impossible in many places for the Macedonians
to pour in the material. But the latter erected two
towers upon the mole, which they had now projected
over a long stretch of sea, and upon these towers they
placed engines of war. Skins and prepared hides served
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>as coverings in front of them, to prevent them being
struck by fire-bearing missiles from the wall, and at the
same time to be a screen against arrows to those who
were working. It was likewise intended that the
Tyrians who might sail near to injure the men engaged
in the construction of the mole should not retire easily,
being assailed by missiles from the towers.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER XIX.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Siege of Tyre.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">But</span> to counteract this the Tyrians adopted the following
contrivance. They filled a vessel, which had been used
for transporting horses, with dry twigs and other combustible
wood, fixed two masts on the prow, and fenced
it round in the form of a circle as large as possible, so
that the enclosure might contain as much chaff and as
many torches as possible. Moreover they placed upon
this vessel quantities of pitch, brimstone, and whatever
else was calculated to foment a great flame.<a name="FNanchor_313" id="FNanchor_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">313</a> They also
stretched out a double yard-arm upon each mast; and
from these they hung caldrons into which they had
poured or cast materials likely to kindle flame which
would extend to a great distance. They then put ballast
into the stern, in order to raise the prow aloft, the vessel
being weighed down abaft.<a name="FNanchor_314" id="FNanchor_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">314</a> Then watching for a wind
bearing towards the mole, they fastened the vessel to
some triremes which towed it before the breeze. As
soon as they approached the mole and the towers, they
threw fire among the wood, and at the same time ran
the vessel, with the triremes, aground as violently as
possible, dashing against the end of the mole. The men
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>in the vessel easily swam away, as soon as it was set on
fire. A great flame soon caught the towers; and the
yard-arms being twisted round poured out into the fire
the materials that had been prepared for kindling the
flame. The men also in the triremes tarrying near the
mole kept on shooting arrows into the towers, so that
it was not safe for men to approach in order to bring
materials to quench the fire. Upon this, when the
towers had already caught fire, many men hastened from
the city, and embarking in light vessels, and striking
against various parts of the mole, easily tore down the
stockade which had been placed in front of it for protection,
and burnt up all the engines of war which the fire
from the vessel did not reach.<a name="FNanchor_315" id="FNanchor_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">315</a> But Alexander began to
construct a wider mole from the mainland, capable of
containing more towers; and he ordered the engine-makers
to prepare fresh engines. While this was being
performed, he took the shield-bearing guards and the
Agrianians and set out to Sidon, to collect there all the
triremes be could; since it was evident that the successful
conclusion of the siege would be much more difficult
to attain, so long as the Tyrians retained the superiority
at sea.<a name="FNanchor_316" id="FNanchor_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">316</a></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Tyre Besieged by Sea as well as Land.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">About</span> this time Gerostratus, King of Aradus, and Enylus,
King of Byblus, ascertaining that their cities were in the
possession of Alexander, deserted Autophradates and
the fleet under his command, and came to Alexander
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>with their naval force, accompanied by the Sidonian
triremes; so that about eighty Phoenician ships joined
him. About the same time triremes also came to him
from Rhodes, both the one called <i>Peripolus</i>,<a name="FNanchor_317" id="FNanchor_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">317</a> and with it
nine others. From Soli and Mallus also came three, and
from Lycia ten; from Macedonia also a ship with fifty
oars, in which sailed Proteas, son of Andronicus.<a name="FNanchor_318" id="FNanchor_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">318</a> Not
long after, too, the kings of Cyprus put into Sidon with
about one hundred and twenty ships, when they heard
of the defeat of Darius at Issus, and were terrified, because
the whole of Phoenicia was already in the possession
of Alexander. To all of these Alexander granted indemnity
for their previous conduct, because they seemed
to have joined the Persian fleet rather by necessity than
by their own choice. While the engines of war were
being constructed for him, and the ships were being
fitted up for a naval attack on the city and for the trial
of a sea-battle, he took some squadrons of cavalry, the
Agrianians and archers, and made an expedition into the
range of mountains called Anti-Libănus.<a name="FNanchor_319" id="FNanchor_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">319</a> Having subdued
some of the mountaineers by force, and drawn
others over to him by terms of capitulation, he returned
to Sidon in ten days.<a name="FNanchor_320" id="FNanchor_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">320</a> Here he found Oleander, son of
Polemocrates, just arrived from Peloponnesus, having
4,000 Grecian mercenaries with him.<a name="FNanchor_321" id="FNanchor_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">321</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span></p>

<p>When his fleet had been arranged in due order, he
embarked upon the decks as many of his shield-bearing
guards as seemed sufficient for his enterprise, unless a
sea-battle were to be fought rather by breaking the
enemy’s line<a name="FNanchor_322" id="FNanchor_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">322</a> than by a close conflict. He then started
from Sidon and sailed towards Tyre with his ships
arranged in proper order, himself being on the right
wing which stretched out seaward; and with him were
the kings of the Cyprians, and all those of the Phoenicians
except Pnytagoras, who with Craterus was commanding
the left wing of the whole line. The Tyrians had
previously resolved to fight a sea-battle, if Alexander
should sail against them by sea. But then with surprise
they beheld the vast multitude of his ships; for they
had not yet learnt that Alexander had all the ships of
the Cyprians and Phoenicians. At the same time they
were surprised to see that he was sailing against them
with his fleet arranged in due order; for Alexander’s
fleet a little before it came near the city, tarried for a
while out in the open sea, with the view of provoking the
Tyrians to come out to a battle; but afterwards, as the
enemy did not put out to sea against them, though they
were thus arranged in line, they advanced to the attack
with a great dashing of oars. Seeing this, the Tyrians
decided not to fight a battle at sea, but closely blocked
up the passage for ships with as many triremes as the
mouths of their harbour would contain, and guarded it,
so that the enemy’s fleet might not find an anchorage in
any of the harbours.</p>

<p>As the Tyrians did not put out to sea against him,
Alexander sailed near the city, but resolved not to try
to force an entrance into the harbour towards Sidon on
account of the narrowness of its mouth; and at the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>time because he saw that the entrance had been blocked
up with many triremes having their prows turned towards
him. But the Phoenicians fell upon the three triremes
moored furthest out at the mouth of the harbour,
and attacking them prow to prow, succeeded in sinking
them. However, the men in the ships easily swam off
to the land which was friendly to them. Then, indeed,
Alexander moored his ships along the shore not far from
the mole which had been made, where there appeared to
be shelter from the winds; and on the following day he
ordered the Cyprians with their ships and their admiral
Andromachus to moor near the city opposite the harbour
which faces towards Sidon, and the Phoenicians opposite
the harbour which looks towards Egypt, situated on the
other side of the mole, where also was his own tent.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER XXI.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Siege of Tyre.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">He</span> had now collected many engineers both from Cyprus
and the whole of Phoenicia, and many engines of war
had been constructed,<a name="FNanchor_323" id="FNanchor_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">323</a> some upon the mole, others upon
vessels used for transporting horses, which he brought
with him from Sidon, and others upon the triremes
which were not fast sailers. When all the preparations
had been completed they brought up the engines of war
along the mole that had been made and also began to
shoot from ships moored near various parts of the wall
and making trial of its strength. The Tyrians erected
wooden towers on their battlements opposite the mole,
from which they might annoy the enemy; and if
the engines of war were brought near any other part,
they defended themselves with missiles and shot at
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>the very ships with fire-bearing arrows, so that they
deterred the Macedonians from approaching the wall.
Their walls opposite the mole were about one hundred
and fifty feet high, with a breadth in proportion, and
constructed with large stones imbedded in gypsum. It
was not easy for the horse-transports and the triremes
of the Macedonians, which were conveying the engines
of war up to the wall, to approach the city, because a
great quantity of stones hurled forward into the sea prevented
their near assault. These stones Alexander determined
to drag out of the sea; but this was a work
accomplished with great difficulty, since it was performed
from ships and not from the firm earth; especially as the
Tyrians, covering their ships with mail, brought them
alongside the anchors of the triremes, and cutting the
cables of the anchors underneath, made anchoring impossible
for the enemy’s ships. But Alexander covered
many thirty-oared vessels with mail in the same way,
and placed them athwart in front of the anchors, so that
the assault of the ships was repelled by them. But,
notwithstanding this, divers under the sea secretly cut
their cables. The Macedonians then used chains to their
anchors instead of cables, and let them down so that the
divers could do no more harm. Then, fastening slip-knots
to the stones, they dragged them out of the sea
from the mole; and having raised them aloft with cranes,
they discharged them into deep water, where they were
no longer likely to do injury by being hurled forward.
The ships now easily approached the part of the wall
where it had been made clear of the stones which had
been hurled forward. The Tyrians being now reduced
to great straits on all sides, resolved to make an attack
on the Cyprian ships, which were moored opposite the
harbour turned towards Sidon. For a long time they
spread sails across the mouth of the harbour, in order
that the filling of the triremes might not be discernible;<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
and about the middle of the day, when the sailors were
scattered in quest of necessaries, and when Alexander
usually retired from the fleet to his tent on the other
side of the city, they filled three quinqueremes, an equal
number of quadriremes and seven triremes with the most
expert complement of rowers possible, and with the best-armed
men adapted for fighting from the decks, together
with the men most daring in naval contests. At first
they rowed out slowly and quietly in single file, moving
forward the handles of their oars without any signal from
the men who give the time to the rowers<a name="FNanchor_324" id="FNanchor_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">324</a>; but when
they were already tacking against the Cyprians, and were
near enough to be seen, then indeed with a loud shout
and encouragement to each other, and at the same time
with impetuous rowing, they commenced the attack.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER XXII.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Siege of Tyre.&mdash;Naval Defeat of the Tyrians.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">It</span> happened on that day that Alexander went away to
his tent, but after a short time returned to his ships, not
tarrying according to his usual custom. The Tyrians
fell all of a sudden upon the ships lying at their moorings,
finding some entirely empty and others being filled
with difficulty from the men who happened to be present
at the very time of the noise and attack. At the first
onset they at once sank the quinquereme of the king
Pnytagoras, that of Androcles the Amathusiau<a name="FNanchor_325" id="FNanchor_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">325</a> and that
of Pasicrates the Curian;<a name="FNanchor_326" id="FNanchor_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">326</a> and they shattered the other
ships by pushing them ashore. But when Alexander
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>perceived the sailing out of the Tyrian triremes, he
ordered most of the ships under his command to be
manned and to take position at the mouth of the harbour,
so that the rest of the Tyrian ships might not sail out.
He then took the quinqueremes which he had and about
five of the triremes, which were manned by him in haste
before the rest were ready, and sailed round the city
against the Tyrians who had sailed out of the harbour.
The men on the wall, perceiving the enemy’s attack and
observing that Alexander himself was in the fleet, began
to shout to those in their own ships, urging them to
return; but as their shouts were not audible, on account
of the noise of those who were engaged in the action,
they exhorted them to retreat by various kinds of signals.
At last after a long time, perceiving the impending
attack of Alexander’s fleet, they tacked about and began
to flee into the harbour; and a few of their ships
succeeded in escaping, but Alexander’s vessels assaulted
the greater number, and rendered some of them unfit for
sailing; and a quinquereme and a quadrireme were
captured at the very mouth of the harbour. But the
slaughter of the marines was not great; for when they
perceived that their ships were in possession of the
enemy, they swam off without difficulty into the harbour.
As the Tyrians could no longer derive any aid from their
ships, the Macedonians now brought up their military
engines to the wall itself. Those which were brought
near the city along the mole, did no damage worth
mentioning on account of the strength of the wall there.
Others brought up some of the ships conveying military
engines opposite the part of the city turned towards
Sidon. But when even there they met with no success,
Alexander passed round to the wall projecting towards
the south wind and towards Egypt, and tested the
strength of the works everywhere. Here first a large
piece of the wall was thoroughly shaken, and a part of<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
it was even broken and thrown down. Then indeed for
a short time he tried to make an assault to the extent of
throwing a bridge upon the part of the wall where a
breach had been made. But the Tyrians without much
difficulty beat the Macedonians back.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER XXIII.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Siege of Tyre.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">The</span> third day after this, having waited for a calm sea,
after encouraging the leaders of the regiments for the
action, he led the ships containing the military engines
up to the city. In the first place he shook down a large
piece of the wall; and when the breach appeared to be
sufficiently wide, he ordered the vessels conveying the
military engines to retire, and brought up two others,
which carried his bridges, which he intended to throw
upon the breach in the wall. The shield-bearing guards
occupied one of these vessels, which he had put under
the command of Admetus; and the other was occupied
by the regiment of Coenus, called the foot Companions.
Alexander himself, with the shield-bearing guards, intended
to scale the wall where it might be practicable.
He ordered some of his triremes to sail against both of
the harbours, to see if by any means they could force
an entrance when the Tyrians had turned themselves
to oppose him. He also ordered those of his triremes
which contained the missiles to be hurled from engines,
or which were carrying archers upon deck, to sail right
round the wall and to put in where it was practicable,
and to take up position within shooting range, until it
became impossible to put in, so that the Tyrians, being
shot at from all quarters, might become distracted, and
not know whither to turn in their distress. When
Alexander’s ships drew close to the city and the bridges<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
were thrown from them upon the wall, the shield-bearing
guards mounted valiantly along these upon the wall; for
their captain, Admetus, proved himself brave on that
occasion, and Alexander accompanied them, both as a
courageous participant in the action itself, and as a
witness of brilliant and dangerous feats of valour performed
by others. The first part of the wall that was
captured was where Alexander had posted himself; the
Tyrians being easily beaten back from it, as soon as the
Macedonians found firm footing, and at the same time
a way of entrance not abrupt on every side. Admetus
was the first to mount the wall; but while cheering on
his men to mount, he was struck with a spear and died
on the spot.</p>

<p>After him, Alexander with the Companions got possession
of the wall<a name="FNanchor_327" id="FNanchor_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">327</a>; and when some of the towers and the
parts of the wall between them were in his hands,
he advanced through the battlements to the royal palace,
because the descent into the city that way seemed the
easiest.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER XXIV.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Capture of Tyre.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">To</span> return to the fleet, the Phoenicians posted opposite
the harbour looking towards Egypt, facing which they
happened to be moored, forcing their way and bursting
the bars asunder, shattered the ships in the harbour,
attacking some of them in deep water and driving others
ashore. The Cyprians also sailed into the other harbour
looking towards Sidon, which had no bar across it, and
made a speedy capture of the city on that side. The
main body of the Tyrians deserted the wall when they
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>saw it in the enemy’s possession; and rallying opposite
what was called the chapel of Agenor,<a name="FNanchor_328" id="FNanchor_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">328</a> they there turned
round to resist the Macedonians. Against these Alexander
advanced with his shield-bearing guards, destroyed
the men who fought there, and pursued those who fled.
Great was the slaughter also made both by those who
were now occupying the city from the harbour and by the
regiment of Coenus, which had also entered it. For the
Macedonians were now for the most part advancing full
of rage, being angry both at the length of the siege and
also because the Tyrians, having captured some of their
men sailing from Sidon, had conveyed them to the top
of their wall, so that the deed might be visible from the
camp, and after slaughtering them, had cast their bodies
into the sea. About 8,000 of the Tyrians were killed;
and of the Macedonians, besides Admetus, who had
proved himself a valiant man, being the first to scale the
wall, twenty of the shield-bearing guards were killed in
the assault on that occasion. In the whole siege about
400 Macedonians were slain. Alexander gave an amnesty
to all those who fled for refuge into the temple of Heracles;
among them being most of the Tyrian magistrates,
including the king Azemilcus, as well as certain envoys
from the Carthaginians, who had come to their mother-city
to attend the sacrifice in honour of Heracles, according
to an ancient custom.<a name="FNanchor_329" id="FNanchor_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">329</a> The rest of the prisoners were
reduced to slavery; all the Tyrians and mercenary troops,
to the number of about 30,000, who had been captured,
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>being sold.<a name="FNanchor_330" id="FNanchor_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">330</a> Alexander then offered sacrifice to Heracles,
and conducted a procession in honour of that deity with
all his soldiers fully armed. The ships also took part
in this religious procession in honour of Heracles. He
moreover held a gymnastic contest in the temple, and
celebrated a torch race. The military engine, also, with
which the wall had been battered down, was brought
into the temple and dedicated as a thank-offering; and
the Tyrian ship sacred to Heracles, which had been captured
in the naval attack, was likewise dedicated to the
god. An inscription was placed on it, either composed
by Alexander himself or by some one else; but as it is
not worthy of recollection, I have not deemed it worth
while to describe it. Thus then was Tyre captured in
the month Hecatombaion, when Anicetus was archon at
Athens.<a name="FNanchor_331" id="FNanchor_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">331</a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXV.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Offers of Darius Rejected.&mdash;Batis, Governor of
Gaza, Refuses to Submit.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">While</span> Alexander was still occupied by the siege of
Tyre, ambassadors came to him from Darius, announcing
that he would give him ten thousand talents<a name="FNanchor_332" id="FNanchor_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">332</a> in exchange
for his mother, wife, and children; that all the territory
west of the river Euphrates, as far as the Grecian Sea,
should be Alexander’s; and proposing that he should
marry the daughter of Darius, and become his friend and
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>ally.<a name="FNanchor_333" id="FNanchor_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">333</a> When these proposals were announced in a
conference of the Companions, Parmenio is said to have
told Alexander, that if he were Alexander he should be
delighted to put an end to the war on these terms, and
incur no further hazard of success. Alexander is said to
have replied, So would he also do, if he were Parmenio,
but as he was Alexander he replied to Darius as he did.
For he said that he was neither in want of money from
Darius, nor would he receive a part of his territory
instead of the whole; for that all his money and territory
were his; and that if he wished to marry the daughter of
Darius, he would marry her, even though Darius refused
her to him. He commanded Darius to come to him if
he wished to experience any generous treatment from
him. When Darius heard this answer, he despaired of
coming to terms with Alexander, and began to make
fresh preparations for war.</p>

<p>Alexander now resolved to make an expedition into
Egypt. All the other parts of what was called Palestine
Syria<a name="FNanchor_334" id="FNanchor_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">334</a> had already yielded to him; but a certain eunuch,
named Batis, who was in possession of the city of Gaza,
paid no heed to him; but procuring Arabian mercenaries,
and having been long employed in laying up sufficient
food for a long siege, he resolved not to admit Alexander
into the city, feeling confident that the place could never
be taken by storm.</p>

<hr />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span></p><h3>CHAPTER XXVI.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Siege of Gaza.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Gaza</span> is about twenty stades from the sea;<a name="FNanchor_335" id="FNanchor_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">335</a> the approach
to it is sandy and over heavy soil, and the sea near the
city everywhere shallow. The city of Gaza<a name="FNanchor_336" id="FNanchor_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">336</a> was large,
and had been built upon a lofty mound, around which a
strong wall had been carried. It is the last city the
traveller meets with going from Phoenicia to Egypt,
being situated on the edge of the desert. When Alexander
arrived near the city, on the first day he encamped
at the spot where the wall seemed to him most easy to
assail, and ordered his military engines to be constructed.
But the engineers expressed the opinion that it was not
possible to capture the wall by force, on account of the
height of the mound. However, the more impracticable
it seemed to be, the more resolutely Alexander determined
that it must be captured. For he said that the
action would strike the enemy with great alarm from its
being contrary to their expectation; whereas his failure
to capture the place would redound to his disgrace when
mentioned either to the Greeks or to Darius. He therefore
resolved to construct a mound right round the city,
so as to be able to bring his military engines up to the
walls from the artificial mound which had been raised to
the same level with them. The mound was constructed
especially over against the southern wall of the city,
where it appeared easiest to make an assault. When he
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>thought that the mound had been raised to the proper
level with the walls, the Macedonians placed their military
engines upon it, and brought them close to the wall of
Gaza. At this time while Alexander was offering sacrifice,
and, crowned with a garland, was about to commence
the first sacred rite according to custom, a certain
carnivorous bird, flying over the altar, let a stone which
it was carrying with its claws fall upon his head. Alexander
asked Aristander, the soothsayer,<a name="FNanchor_337" id="FNanchor_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">337</a> what this omen
meant. He replied: “O king, thou wilt indeed capture
the city, but thou must take care of thyself on this day.”</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER XXVII.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Capture of Gaza.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">When</span> Alexander heard this, he kept himself for a time
near the military engines, out of the reach of missiles.
But when a vigorous sortie was made from the city, and
the Arabs were carrying torches to set fire to the military
engines, and from their commanding position above
hurling missiles at the Macedonians, who were defending
themselves from lower ground, were driving them down
from the mound which they had made, then Alexander
either wilfully disobeyed the soothsayer, or forgot the
prophecy from excitement in the heat of action. Taking
the shield-bearing guards, he hastened to the rescue
where the Macedonians were especially hard pressed, and
prevented them from being driven down from the mound
in disgraceful flight. But he was himself wounded
by a bolt from a catapult, right through the shield and
breastplate into the shoulder. When he perceived that
Aristander had spoken the truth about the wound, he
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>rejoiced, because he thought he should also capture the
city by the aid of the soothsayer. And yet indeed he
was not easily cured of the wound. In the meantime the
military engines with which he had captured Tyre arrived,
having been sent for by sea; and be ordered the mound
to be constructed quite round the city on all sides, two
stades<a name="FNanchor_338" id="FNanchor_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">338</a> in breadth and 250 feet in height. When his
engines had been prepared, and brought up along the
mound, they shook down a large extent of wall; and
mines being dug in various places, and the earth being
drawn out by stealth, the wall fell down in many parts,
subsiding into the emptied space.<a name="FNanchor_339" id="FNanchor_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">339</a> The Macedonians
then commanded a large extent of ground with their
missiles, driving back the men who were defending the
city, from the towers. Nevertheless, the men of the city
sustained three assaults, though many of their number
were killed or wounded; but at the fourth attack,
Alexander led up the phalanx of the Macedonians from
all sides, threw down the part of the wall which was
undermined, and shook down another large portion of it
by battering it with his engines, so that he rendered the
assault an easy matter through the breaches with his
scaling ladders. Accordingly the ladders were brought
up to the wall; and then there arose a great emulation
among those of the Macedonians who laid any claim to
valour, to see who should be the first to scale the wall.
The first to do so was Neoptolemus, one of the Companions,
of the family of the Aeacidae; and after him
mounted one rank after another with their officers.
When once some of the Macedonians got within the wall,
they split open in succession the gates which each party
happened to light upon, and thus admitted the whole
army into the city. But though their city was now in
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>the hands of the enemy, the Gazaeans nevertheless stood
together and fought; so that they were all slain fighting
there, as each man had been stationed. Alexander sold
their wives and children into slavery; and having peopled
the city again from the neighbouring settlers, he made
use of it as a fortified post for the war.<a name="FNanchor_340" id="FNanchor_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">340</a></p>

on the seventh day he arrived at Pelusium<a name="FNanchor_341" id="FNanchor_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">341</a> in Egypt.
His fleet had also set sail from Phoenicia to Egypt;
and he found the ships already moored at Pelusium.<a name="FNanchor_342" id="FNanchor_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">342</a>
When Mazaces the Persian, whom Darius had appointed
viceroy of Egypt,<a name="FNanchor_343" id="FNanchor_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">343</a> ascertained how the battle at Issus
had resulted, that Darius had fled in disgraceful flight,
and that Phoenicia, Syria, and most of Arabia were
already in Alexander’s possession, as he had no Persian

and ordering the men in the ships to sail up the river as
far as the city of Memphis,<a name="FNanchor_345" id="FNanchor_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">345</a> he went in person towards
Heliopolis,<a name="FNanchor_346" id="FNanchor_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">346</a> having the river Nile<a name="FNanchor_347" id="FNanchor_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">347</a> on his right. He
reached that city through the desert, after getting
possession of all the places on the march through the
voluntary surrender of the inhabitants. Thence he
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>crossed the stream and came to Memphis; where he
offered sacrifice to Apis<a name="FNanchor_348" id="FNanchor_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">348</a> and the other gods, and celebrated
a gymnastic and musical contest, the most distinguished
artists in these matters coming to him from
Greece. From Memphis he sailed down the river towards
the sea, embarking the shield-bearing guards,
the archers, the Agrianians, and of the cavalry the royal
squadron of the Companions. Coming to Canobus,<a name="FNanchor_349" id="FNanchor_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">349</a> he
sailed round the Marian lake,<a name="FNanchor_350" id="FNanchor_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">350</a> and disembarked where
now is situated the city of Alexandria, which takes its
name from him. The position seemed to him a very fine
one in which to found a city, and he foresaw that it
would become a prosperous one.<a name="FNanchor_351" id="FNanchor_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">351</a> Therefore he was
seized by an ardent desire to undertake the enterprise,
and himself marked out the boundaries of the city, pointing
out the place where the agora was to be constructed,
where the temples were to be built, stating how many
there were to be, and to what Grecian gods they were to
be dedicated, and specially marking a spot for a temple
to the Egyptian Isis.<a name="FNanchor_352" id="FNanchor_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">352</a> He also pointed out where the

favourable.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Foundation of Alexandria.&mdash;Events in the Aegean.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">The</span> following story is told, which seems to me not un<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>worthy
of belief<a name="FNanchor_353" id="FNanchor_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">353</a>:&mdash;that Alexander himself wished to
leave behind for the builders the marks for the boundaries
of the fortification, but that there was nothing at
hand with which to make a furrow in the ground. One
of the builders<a name="FNanchor_354" id="FNanchor_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">354</a> hit upon the plan of collecting in vessels
the barley which the soldiers were carrying, and throwing
it upon the ground where the king led the way;
and thus the circle of the fortification which he was
making<a name="FNanchor_355" id="FNanchor_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">355</a> for the city was completely marked out. The
soothsayers, and especially Aristander the Telmissian,
who was said already to have given many other true
predictions, pondering this, told Alexander that the city
would become prosperous in every respect, but especially
in regard to the fruits of the earth.</p>

<p>At this time Hegelochus<a name="FNanchor_356" id="FNanchor_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">356</a> sailed to Egypt and informed
Alexander that the Tenedians had revolted from the
Persians and attached themselves to him; because they
had gone over to the Persians against their own wish.
He also said that the democracy of Chios were introducing
Alexander’s adherents in spite of those who held
the city, being established in it by Autophradates and
Pharnabazus. The latter commander had been caught
there and kept as a prisoner, as was also the despot
Aristonicus, a Methymnaean,<a name="FNanchor_357" id="FNanchor_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">357</a> who sailed into the harbour
of Chios with five piratical vessels, fitted with one
and a half banks of oars, not knowing that the harbour
was in the hands of Alexander’s adherents, but being
misled by those who kept the bars of the harbour, because
forsooth the fleet of Pharnabazus was moored in it. All
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>the pirates were there massacred by the Chians; and
Hegelochus brought to Alexander, as prisoners Aristonicus,
Apollonides the Chian, Phisinus, Megareus, and
all the others who had taken part in the revolt of Chios
to the Persians, and who at that time were holding the
government of the island by force. He also announced
that he had deprived Chares<a name="FNanchor_358" id="FNanchor_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">358</a> of the possession of
Mitylene, that he had brought over the other cities in
Lesbos by a voluntary agreement, and that he had sent
Amphoterus to Cos with sixty ships, for the Coans themselves
invited him to their island. He said that he himself
had sailed to Cos and found it already in the hands
of Amphoterus. Hegelochus brought all the prisoners
with him except Pharnabazus, who had eluded his guards
at Cos and got away by stealth. Alexander sent the
despots who had been brought from the cities back to
their fellow-citizens, to be treated as they pleased; but
Apollonides and his Chian partisans he sent under a
strict guard to Elephantinē, an Egyptian city.<a name="FNanchor_359" id="FNanchor_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">359</a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Alexander Visits the Temple of Ammon.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">After</span> these transactions, Alexander was seized by an
ardent desire to visit Ammon<a name="FNanchor_360" id="FNanchor_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">360</a> in Libya, partly in order
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>to consult the god, because the oracle of Ammon was
said to be exact in its information, and Perseus and
Heracles were said to have consulted it, the former when
he was despatched by Polydectes<a name="FNanchor_361" id="FNanchor_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">361</a> against the Gorgons,
and the latter, when he visited Antaeus<a name="FNanchor_362" id="FNanchor_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">362</a> in Libya and
Busiris<a name="FNanchor_363" id="FNanchor_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">363</a> in Egypt. Alexander was also partly urged by
a desire of emulating Perseus and Heracles, from both
of whom he traced his descent.<a name="FNanchor_364" id="FNanchor_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">364</a> He also deduced his
pedigree from Ammon, just as the legends traced that of
Heracles and Perseus to Zeus. Accordingly he made
the expedition to Ammon with the design of learning his
own origin more certainly, or at least that he might be
able to say that he had learned it. According to Aristobulus,
he advanced along the seashore to Paraetonium
through a country which was a desert, but not destitute
of water, a distance of about 1,600 stades.<a name="FNanchor_365" id="FNanchor_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">365</a> Thence he
turned into the interior, where the oracle of Ammon was
located. The route is desert, and most of it is sand and
destitute of water. But there was a copious supply of
rain for Alexander, a thing which was attributed to the
influence of the deity; as was also the following occurrence.
Whenever a south wind blows in that district, it
heaps up the sand upon the route far and wide, rendering
the tracks of the road invisible, so that it is impossible to
discover where one ought to direct one’s course in the sand,
just as if one were at sea; for there are no landmarks
along the road, neither mountain anywhere, nor tree,
nor permanent hill standing erect, by which travellers
might be able to form a conjecture of the right course, as
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>sailors do by the stars.<a name="FNanchor_366" id="FNanchor_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">366</a> Consequently, Alexander’s
army lost the way, and even the guides were in doubt
about the course to take. Ptolemy, son of Lagus, says
that two serpents went in front of the army, uttering a
voice, and Alexander ordered the guides to follow them,
trusting in the divine portent. He says too that they
showed the way to the oracle and back again. But
Aristobulus, whose account is generally admitted as correct,
says that two ravens flew in front of the army, and
that these acted as Alexander’s guides. I am able to
assert with confidence that some divine assistance was
afforded him, for probability also coincides with the
supposition; but the discrepancies in the details of the
various narratives have deprived the story of certainty.<a name="FNanchor_367" id="FNanchor_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">367</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Oasis of Ammon.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">The</span> place where the temple of Ammon is located is
entirely surrounded by a desert of far-stretching sand,
which is destitute of water. The fertile spot in the midst
of this desert, is not extensive; for where it stretches into
its greater expanse, it is only about forty stades broad.<a name="FNanchor_368" id="FNanchor_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">368</a>
It is full of cultivated trees, olives and palms; and it is
the only place in those parts which is refreshed with dew.
A spring also rises from it, quite unlike all the other
springs which issue from the earth.<a name="FNanchor_369" id="FNanchor_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">369</a> For at midday the
water is cold to the taste, and still more so to the touch,
as cold as cold can be. But when the sun has sunk into
the west, it gets warmer, and from the evening it keeps
on growing warmer until midnight, when it reaches the
warmest point. After midnight it goes on getting
gradually colder; at daybreak it is already cold; but at
midday it reaches the coldest point. Every day it undergoes
these alternate changes in regular succession. In this
place also natural salt is procured by digging, and certain
of the priests of Ammon convey quantities of it into
Egypt. For whenever they set out for Egypt they put
it into little boxes plaited out of palm, and carry it as
a present to the king, or some other great man. The
grains of this salt are large, some of them being even
longer than three fingers’ breadth; and it is clear like
crystal.<a name="FNanchor_370" id="FNanchor_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">370</a> The Egyptians and others who are respectful
to the deity, use this salt in their sacrifices, as it is
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>clearer than that which is procured from the sea. Alexander
then was struck with wonder at the place, and
consulted the oracle of the god. Having heard what
was agreeable to his wishes, as he himself said, he set
out on the journey back to Egypt by the same route,
according to the statement of Aristobulus; but according
to that of Ptolemy, son of Lagus, he took another
road, leading straight to Memphis.<a name="FNanchor_371" id="FNanchor_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">371</a></p>

<hr />

<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Settlement of the Affairs of Egypt.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">At</span> Memphis, many embassies from Greece reached him;
and he sent away no one disappointed by the rejection
of his suit. From Antipater also arrived an army of 400
Grecian mercenaries under the command of Menidas,
son of Hegesander: likewise from Thrace 500 cavalry,
under the direction of Asclepiodorus, son of Eunicus.
Here he offered sacrifice to Zeus the King, led his soldiers
fully armed in solemn procession, and celebrated a gymnastic
and musical contest. He then settled the affairs
of Egypt, by appointing two Egyptians, Doloaspis and
Petisis, governors of the country, dividing between them
the whole land; but as Petisis declined his province,
Doloaspis received the whole. He appointed two of the
Companions to be commandants of garrisons: Pantaleon
the Pydnaean in Memphis, and Polemo, son of Megacles,
a Pellaean, in Pelusium. He also gave the command of
the Grecian auxiliaries to Lycidas, an Aetolian, and ap<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>pointed
Eugnostus, son of Xenophantes, one of the Companions,
to be secretary over the same troops. As their
overseers he placed Aeschўlus and Ephippus the Chalcidean.
The government of the neighbouring country of
Libya he granted to Apollonius, son of Charinus; and
the part of Arabia near Heroöpolis<a name="FNanchor_372" id="FNanchor_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">372</a> he put under
Cleomenes, a man of Naucratis.<a name="FNanchor_373" id="FNanchor_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">373</a> This last was ordered
to allow the governors to rule their respective districts
according to the ancient custom; but to collect from
them the tribute due to him. The native governors were
also ordered to pay it to Cleomenes. He appointed
Peucestas, son of Macartatus, and Balacrus, son of
Amyntas, generals of the army which he left behind in
Egypt; and he placed Polemo, son of Theramenes, over
the fleet as admiral. He made Leonnatus, son of Anteas,
one of his body-guards instead of Arrhybas, who had
died of disease. Antiochus, the commander of the
archers, also died; and in his stead Ombrion the Cretan
was appointed. When Balacrus was left behind in
Egypt, the allied Grecian infantry, which had been under
his command, was put under that of Calanus. Alexander
was said to have divided the government of Egypt
among so many men, because he was surprised at the
natural strength of the country, and he thought it unsafe
to entrust the rule of the whole to a single person. The
Romans also seem to me to have learned a lesson from
him, and therefore keep Egypt under strong guard; for
they do not send any of the senators thither as proconsul
for the same reason, but only men who have the rank
among them of Equites (Knights).<a name="FNanchor_374" id="FNanchor_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">374</a></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">March into Syria.&mdash;Alexander’s Kindness to Harpalus
and his other early Adherents.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">As</span> soon as spring began to appear, he went from Memphis
to Phoenicia, bridging the stream of the Nile near
Memphis, as well as the canals issuing from it. When
he arrived at Tyre, he found his fleet already there.<a name="FNanchor_375" id="FNanchor_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">375</a> In
this city he again offered sacrifice to Heracles, and celebrated
both a gymnastic and musical contest. While
there, the state vessel called the <i>Paralus</i> came to him
from Athens, bringing Diophantus and Achilleus as
envoys to him; and all the crew of the <i>Paralus</i> were
joined with them in the embassy.<a name="FNanchor_376" id="FNanchor_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">376</a> These men obtained
all the requests which they were despatched to make,
and the king gave up to the Athenians all their fellow-citizens
who had been captured at the Granicus.<a name="FNanchor_377" id="FNanchor_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">377</a> Being
informed that revolutionary plans had been carried out
in the Peloponnese, he sent Amphoterus thither to assist
those of the Peloponnesians who were firm in their support
of his war against Persia, and were not under the
control of the Lacedaemonians. He also commanded the
Phoenicians and Cyprians to despatch to the Peloponnese
100 other ships in addition to those which he was sending
with Amphoterus. He now started up into the interior
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>towards Thapsacus and the river Euphrates, after placing
Coeranus, a Beroean<a name="FNanchor_378" id="FNanchor_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">378</a> over the levy of tribute in Phoenicia,
and Philoxenus to collect it in Asia as far as the Taurus.
In the place of these men he entrusted the custody of
the money which he had with him to Harpalus, son of
Machatas, who had just returned from exile. For this
man at first had been banished, while Philip was still
king, because he was an adherent of Alexander; as also
was Ptolemy, son of Lagus, for the same reason; likewise
Nearchus, son of Androtimus, Erigyius, son of Larichus,
and his brother Laomedon. For Alexander fell under
Philip’s suspicion when the latter married Eurydice<a name="FNanchor_379" id="FNanchor_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">379</a> and
treated Alexander’s mother Olympias with dishonour.
But after Philip’s death those who had been banished
on Alexander’s account returned from exile and were
received into favour. He made Ptolemy one of his confidential
body-guards; he placed Harpalus over the
money, because his bodily strength was unequal to the
fatigues of war. Erigyius was made commander of the
allied Grecian cavalry; and his brother Laomedon, because
he could speak both the Greek and Persian languages
and could read Persian writings, was put in charge
of the foreign prisoners. Nearchus also was appointed
viceroy of Lycia and of the land adjacent to it as far as
mount Taurus. But shortly before the battle which was
fought at Issus, Harpalus fell under the influence of
Tauriscus, an evil man, and fled in his company. The
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>latter started off to Alexander the Epirote<a name="FNanchor_380" id="FNanchor_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">380</a> in Italy,
where he soon after died. But Harpalus found a refuge
in Megaris, whence however Alexander persuaded him
to return, giving him a pledge that he should be none
the worse on account of his desertion. When he came
back, he not only received no punishment, but was
even reinstated in the office of treasurer. Menander,
one of the Companions, was sent away into Lydia as
viceroy; and Clearchus was put in command of the
Grecian auxiliaries who had been under Menander.
Asclepiodorus, son of Eunicus, was also appointed viceroy
of Syria instead of Arimmas, because the latter seemed
to have been remiss in collecting the supplies which he
had been ordered to collect for the army which the king
was about to lead into the interior.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER VII.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Passage of the Euphrates and Tigris.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Alexander</span> arrived at Thapsacus in the month Hecatombaion,<a name="FNanchor_381" id="FNanchor_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">381</a>
in the archonship of Aristophanes at Athens; and
he found that two bridges of boats had been constructed
over the stream. But Mazaeus, to whom Darius had
committed the duty of guarding the river, with about
3,000 cavalry, 2,000 of which were Grecian mercenaries,
was up to that time keeping guard there at the river.
For this reason the Macedonians had not constructed the
complete bridge as far as the opposite bank, being afraid
that Mazaeus might make an assault upon the bridge
where it ended. But when he heard that Alexander
was approaching, he went off in flight with all his army.
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>As soon as he had fled, the bridges were completed as
far as the further bank, and Alexander crossed upon
them with his army.<a name="FNanchor_382" id="FNanchor_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">382</a> Thence he marched up into the
interior through the land called Mesopotamia, having the
river Euphrates and the mountains of Armenia on his
left. When he started from the Euphrates he did not
march to Babylon by the direct road; because by going
the other route be found all things easier for the march
of his army, and it was also easier to obtain fodder for
the horses and provisions for the men from the country.
Besides this, the heat was not so scorching on the indirect
route. Some of the men from Darius’s army, who were
dispersed for the purpose of scouting, were taken
prisoners; and they reported that Darius was encamped
near the river Tigris, having resolved to prevent Alexander
from crossing that stream. They also said that
he had a much larger army than that with which he had
fought in Cilicia. Hearing this, Alexander went with
all speed towards the Tigris; but when be reached it
he found neither Darius himself nor any guard which
he had left. However he experienced great difficulty in
crossing the stream, on account of the swiftness of the
current,<a name="FNanchor_383" id="FNanchor_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">383</a> though no one tried to stop him. There be
made his army rest, and while so doing, an eclipse of
the moon nearly total occurred.<a name="FNanchor_384" id="FNanchor_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">384</a> Alexander thereupon
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>offered sacrifice to the moon, the sun and the earth,
whose deed this was, according to common report.
Aristander thought that this eclipse of the moon was
a portent favourable to Alexander and the Macedonians;
that there would be a battle that very month, and that
victory for Alexander was signified by the sacrificial victims.
Having therefore decamped from the Tigris, he
went through the land of Aturia,<a name="FNanchor_385" id="FNanchor_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">385</a> having the mountains
of the Gordyaeans<a name="FNanchor_386" id="FNanchor_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">386</a> on the left and the Tigris itself on
the right; and on the fourth day after the passage of the
river, his scouts brought word to him that the enemy’s
cavalry were visible there along the plain, but how many
of them there were they could not guess. Accordingly
he drew his army up in order and advanced prepared
for battle. Other scouts again riding forward and taking
more accurate observations, told him that the cavalry did
not seem to them to be more than 1,000 in number.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Description of Darius’s Army at Arbela.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Alexander</span> therefore took the royal squadron of cavalry,
and one squadron of the Companions, together with the
Paeonian scouts, and marched with all speed; having
ordered the rest of his army to follow at leisure. The
Persian cavalry, seeing Alexander advancing quickly,
began to flee with all their might. Though he pressed
close upon them in pursuit, most of them escaped; but
a few, whose horses were fatigued by the flight, were
slain, others were taken prisoners, horses and all. From
these they ascertained that Darius with a large force was
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>not far off. For the Indians who were conterminous
with the Bactrians, as also the Bactrians themselves and
the Sogdianians had come to the aid of Darius, all being
under the command of Bessus, the viceroy of the land
of Bactria. They were accompanied by the Sacians, a
Scythian tribe belonging to the Scythians who dwell
in Asia.<a name="FNanchor_387" id="FNanchor_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">387</a> These were not subject to Bessus, but were
in alliance with Darius. They were commanded by
Mavaces, and were horse-bowmen. Barsaëntes, the
viceroy of Arachotia, led the Arachotians<a name="FNanchor_388" id="FNanchor_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">388</a> and the men
who were called mountaineer Indians. Satibarzanes, the

the Parthians, Hyrcanians, and Tapurians,<a name="FNanchor_390" id="FNanchor_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">390</a> all of whom
were horsemen. Atropates commanded the Medes, with
whom were arrayed the Cadusians, Albanians, and Sacesinians.<a name="FNanchor_391" id="FNanchor_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">391</a>
The men who dwelt near the Red Sea<a name="FNanchor_392" id="FNanchor_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">392</a> were
marshalled by Ocondobates, Ariobarzanes, and Otanes.
The Uxians and Susianians<a name="FNanchor_393" id="FNanchor_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">393</a> acknowledged Oxathres
son of Aboulites as their leader, and the Babylonians
were commanded by Boupares. The Carians who had
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>been deported into central Asia, and the Sitacenians<a name="FNanchor_394" id="FNanchor_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">394</a>
had been placed in the same ranks as the Babylonians.
The Armenians were commanded by Orontes and
Mithraustes, and the Cappadocians by Ariaces. The
Syrians from the vale between Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon
(<i>i.e.</i> Coele-Syria) and the men of Syria which
lies between the rivers<a name="FNanchor_395" id="FNanchor_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">395</a> were led by Mazaeus. The
whole army of Darius was said to contain 40,000 cavalry,
1,000,000 infantry, and 200 scythe-bearing chariots.<a name="FNanchor_396" id="FNanchor_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">396</a>
There were only a few elephants, about fifteen in number,
belonging to the Indians who live this side of the Indus.<a name="FNanchor_397" id="FNanchor_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">397</a>
With these forces Darius had encamped at Gaugamela,
near the river Bumodus, about 600 stades distant from
the city of Arbela, in a district everywhere level;<a name="FNanchor_398" id="FNanchor_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">398</a> for
whatever ground thereabouts was unlevel and unfit for
the evolutions of cavalry, had long before been levelled
by the Persians, and made fit for the easy rolling of
chariots and for the galloping of horses. For there were
some who persuaded Darius that he had forsooth got the
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>worst of it in the battle fought at Issus, from the narrowness
of the battle-field; and this he was easily induced to
believe.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER IX.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Alexander’s Tactics.&mdash;His Speech to the Officers.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">When</span> Alexander had received all this information from
the Persian scouts who had been captured, he remained
four days in the place where he had received the news;
and gave his army rest after the march. He meanwhile
fortified his camp with a ditch and stockade, as he intended
to leave behind the baggage and all the soldiers
who were unfit for fighting, and to go into the contest
accompanied by his warriors carrying with them nothing
except their weapons. Accordingly he took his forces
by night, and began the march about the second watch,
in order to come into collision with the foreigners at
break of day. As soon as Darius was informed of
Alexander’s approach, he at once drew out his army for
battle; and Alexander led on his men drawn up in like
manner. Though the armies were only sixty stades<a name="FNanchor_399" id="FNanchor_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">399</a>
from each other, yet they were not in sight of each other,
for between the hostile forces some hills intervened. But
when Alexander was only thirty stades distant from the
enemy, and his army was already marching down from
the hills just mentioned, catching sight of the foreigners,
he caused his phalanx to halt there. Calling a council of
the Companions, generals, cavalry officers, and leaders of
the Grecian allies and mercenaries, he deliberated with
them, whether he should at once lead on the phalanx without
delay, as most of them urged him to do; or, whether,
as Parmenio thought preferable, to pitch their tents there
for the present, to reconnoitre all the ground, in order to
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>see if there was anything there to excite suspicion or to
impede their progress, or if there were ditches or stakes
firmly fixed in the earth out of sight, as well as to make
a more accurate survey of the enemy’s tactical arrangements.
Parmenio’s opinion prevailed, so they encamped
there, drawn up in the order in which they intended to
enter the battle. But Alexander took the light infantry
and the cavalry Companions and went all round, reconnoitring
the whole country where he was about to fight
the battle. Having returned, he again called together
the same leaders, and said that they did not require to be
encouraged by him to enter the contest; for they had
been long before encouraged by their own valour, and
by the gallant deeds which they had already so often
achieved. He thought it expedient that each of them
individually should stir up his own men separately; the
infantry captain the men of his company, the cavalry
captain his own squadron, the brigadiers their various
brigades, and each of the leaders of the infantry the
phalanx entrusted to him. He assured them that in this
battle they were going to fight, not as before, either for
Coele-Syria, Phoenicia, or Egypt, but for the whole of
Asia. For he said this battle would decide who were to
be the rulers of that continent. It was not necessary for
him to stir them up to gallant deeds by many words,
since they had this valour by nature; but they should
see that each man took care, so far as in him lay, to
preserve discipline in the critical moment of action,
and to keep perfect silence when it was expedient to
advance in silence. On the other hand, they should see
that each man uttered a sonorous shout, where it would
be advantageous to shout, and to raise as terrible a
battle-cry as possible, when a suitable opportunity occurred
of raising the battle-cry. He told them to take
care to obey his orders as quickly as possible, and to
transmit the orders they had received to the ranks with<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
all rapidity; each man remembering that both as an
individual and in the aggregate he was increasing the
general danger if he was remiss in the discharge of his
duty, and that he was assisting to gain a victory if he
zealously put forth his utmost exertions.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER X.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rejection of Parmenio’s Advice.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">With</span> these words and others like them he briefly exhorted
his officers, and in return was exhorted by them
to feel confidence in their valour. He then ordered the
soldiers to take dinner and to rest themselves. It is said
that Parmenio came to him in his tent, and urged him
to make a night attack on the Persians; saying that
thus he would fall upon them unprepared and in a state
of confusion, and at the same time more liable to a panic
in the dark.<a name="FNanchor_400" id="FNanchor_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">400</a> But the reply which he made, as others
were listening to their conversation, was, that it would
be mean to steal a victory, and that Alexander ought to
conquer in open daylight, and without any artifice. This
vaunting did not appear any arrogance on his part, but
rather to indicate self-confidence amid dangers. To me
at any rate, he seems to have used correct reasoning
in such a matter. For in the night many accidents
have occurred unexpectedly to those who were sufficiently
prepared for battle as well as to those who were deficiently
prepared, which have caused the superior party
to fail in their plans, and have handed the victory over
to the inferior party, contrary to the expectations of both
sides. Though Alexander was generally fond of encountering
danger in battle, the night appeared to him
perilous; and, besides, if Darius were again defeated,
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>a furtive and nocturnal attack on the part of the Macedonians
would relieve him of the necessity of confessing
that he was an inferior general and commanded inferior
troops. Moreover, if any unexpected defeat befell his
army, the circumjacent country was friendly to the enemy,
and they were acquainted with the locality, whereas the
Macedonians<a name="FNanchor_401" id="FNanchor_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">401</a> were unacquainted with it, and surrounded
by nothing but foes, of whom there were a great number
prisoners. These would be a great source of anxiety,
as they would be likely to assist in attacking them in the
night, not only if they should meet with defeat, but even
if they did not appear to be gaining a decisive victory.
For this way of reasoning I commend Alexander; and I
think him no less worthy of admiration for his excessive
desire to fight in open daylight.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER XI.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Tactics of the Opposing Generals.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Darius</span> and his army remained drawn up during the night
in the same order as that in which they had first arrayed
themselves; because they had not surrounded themselves
with a completely entrenched camp, and, moreover, they
were afraid that the enemy would attack them in the
night. The success of the Persians, on this occasion, was
impeded especially by this long standing on watch with
their arms, and by the fear which usually springs up
before great dangers; which, however, was not then
suddenly aroused by a momentary panic, but had been
experienced for a long time, and had thoroughly cowed
their spirits.<a name="FNanchor_402" id="FNanchor_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">402</a> The army of Darius was drawn up in the
following manner: for, according to the statement of
Aristobulus, the written scheme of arrangement drawn
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>up by Darius was afterwards captured. His left wing
was held by the Bactrian cavalry, in conjunction with the
Daans<a name="FNanchor_403" id="FNanchor_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">403</a> and Arachotians; near these had been posted
the Persians, horse and foot mixed together; next to
these the Susians, and then the Cadusians. This was
the arrangement of the left wing as far as the middle
of the whole phalanx. On the right had been posted
the men from Coele-Syria and Mesopotamia. On the
right again were the Medes; next to them the Parthians
and Sacians; then the Tapurians and Hyrcanians,
and last the Albanians and Sacesinians, extending as
far as the middle of the whole phalanx. In the centre
where King Darius was, had been posted the king’s
kinsmen,<a name="FNanchor_404" id="FNanchor_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">404</a> the Persian guards carrying spears with golden
apples at the butt end,<a name="FNanchor_405" id="FNanchor_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">405</a> the Indians, the Carians who
had been forcibly removed to Central Asia, and the
Mardian archers.<a name="FNanchor_406" id="FNanchor_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">406</a> The Uxians, the Babylonians, the
men who dwell near the Red Sea, and the Sitacenians
had also been drawn up in deep column. On the left,
opposite Alexander’s right, had been posted the Scythian
cavalry, about 1,000 Bactrians and 100 scythe-bearing
chariots. In front of Darius’s royal squadron of cavalry
stood the elephants and 50 chariots. In front of the
right wing the Armenian and Cappadocian cavalry with
50 scythe-bearing chariots had been posted. The Greek
mercenaries, as alone capable of coping with the Macedonians,
were stationed right opposite their phalanx, in
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>two divisions close beside Darius himself and his Persian
attendants, one division on each side.<a name="FNanchor_407" id="FNanchor_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">407</a></p>

<p>Alexander’s army was marshalled as follows: The
right wing was held by the cavalry Companions, in front
of whom had been posted the royal squadron, commanded
by Clitus, son of Dropidas. Near this was
the squadron of Glaucias, next to it that of Aristo, then
that of Sopolis, son of Hermodorus, then that of Heraclides,
son of Antiochus. Near this was that of Demetrius,
son of Althaemenes, then that of Meleager, and last
one of the royal squadrons commanded by Hegelochus,
son of Hippostratus. All the cavalry Companions were
under the supreme command of Philotas, son of Parmenio.
Of the phalanx of Macedonian infantry, nearest
to the cavalry had been posted first the select corps of
shield-bearing guards, and then the rest of the shield-bearing-guards,
under the command of Nicanor, son of
Parmenio. Next to these was the brigade of Coenus,
son of Polemocrates; after these that of Perdiceas, son
of Orontes, then that of Meleager, son of Neoptolemus,
then that of Polysperchon,<a name="FNanchor_408" id="FNanchor_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">408</a> son of Simmias, and last
that of Amyntas, son of Andromenes, under the command
of Simmias, because Amyntas had been despatched
to Macedonia to levy an army. The brigade of Craterus,
son of Alexander, held the left end of the Macedonian
phalanx, and this general commanded the left wing of
the infantry.<a name="FNanchor_409" id="FNanchor_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">409</a> Next to him was the allied Grecian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>cavalry, under the command of Erigyius, son of Larichus.
Next to these, towards the left wing of the army, were
the Thessalian cavalry, under the command of Philip,
son of Menelaüs. But the whole left wing was led by
Parmenio, son of Philotas, round whose person were
ranged the Pharsalian horsemen, who were both the best
and most numerous squadron of the Thessalian cavalry.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER XII.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Alexander’s Tactics.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">In</span> this way had Alexander marshalled his army in front;
but he also posted a second array, so that his phalanx
might be a double one.<a name="FNanchor_410" id="FNanchor_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">410</a> Directions had been given to
the commanders of these men posted in reserve, to wheel
round and receive the attack of the foreigners, if they
should see their own comrades surrounded by the Persian
army. Next to the royal squadron on the right
wing, half of the Agrianians, under the command of
Attalus, in conjunction with the Macedonian archers
under Briso’s command, were posted angular-wise (<i>i.e.</i>
in such a way that the wings were thrown forward at an
angle with the centre, so as to take the enemy in flank)
in case they should be seized anyhow by the necessity
of folding back the phalanx or of closing it up (<i>i.e.</i> of
deepening it by countermarching from front to rear).
Next to the archers were the men called the veteran
mercenaries, whose commander was Cleander. In front
of the Agrianians and archers were posted the light
cavalry used for skirmishing, and the Paeonians, under
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>the command of Aretes and Aristo. In front of all had
been posted the Grecian mercenary cavalry under the
direction of Menidas; and in front of the royal squadron
of cavalry and the other Companions had been posted
half of the Agrianians and archers, and the javelin-men of
Balacrus who had been ranged opposite the scythe-bearing
chariots. Instructions had been given to Menidas
and the troops under him to wheel round and attack the
enemy in flank, if they should ride round their wing.
Thus had Alexander arranged matters on the right wing.
On the left the Thracians under the command of Sitalces
had been posted angular-wise, and near them the cavalry
of the Grecian allies, under the direction of Coeranus.
Next stood the Odrysian cavalry, under the command of
Agatho, son of Tyrimmas. In this part, in front of
all, were posted the auxiliary cavalry of the Grecian
mercenaries, under the direction of Andromachus, son
of Hiero. Near the baggage the infantry from Thrace
were posted as a guard. The whole of Alexander’s army
numbered 7,000 cavalry and about 40,000 infantry.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER XIII.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Battle of Arbela.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">When</span> the armies drew near each other, Darius and the
men around him were observed; viz. the apple-bearing
Persians, the Indians, the Albanians, the Carians who
had been forcibly transported into Central Asia, the
Mardian archers ranged opposite Alexander himself and
his royal squadron of cavalry. Alexander led his own
army more towards the right, and the Persians marched
along parallel with him, far outflanking him upon their
left.<a name="FNanchor_411" id="FNanchor_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">411</a> Then the Scythian cavalry rode along the line,
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>and came into conflict with the front men of Alexander’s
array; but he nevertheless still continued to march towards
the right, and almost entirely got beyond the
ground which had been cleared and levelled by the
Persians.<a name="FNanchor_412" id="FNanchor_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">412</a> Then Darius, fearing that his chariots would
become useless, if the Macedonians advanced into uneven
ground, ordered the front ranks of his left wing to
ride round the right wing of the Macedonians, where
Alexander was commanding, to prevent him from marching
his wing any further. This being done, Alexander
ordered the cavalry of the Grecian mercenaries under
the command of Menidas to attack them. But the
Scythian cavalry and the Bactrians, who had been drawn
up with them sallied forth against them, and being much
more numerous they put the small body of Greeks to
rout. Alexander then ordered Aristo at the head of
the Paeonians and Grecian auxiliaries to attack the
Scythians; and the barbarians gave way. But the rest
of the Bactrians drawing near to the Paeonians and
Grecian auxiliaries, caused their own comrades who were
already in flight to turn and renew the battle; and thus
they brought about a general cavalry engagement, in
which many of Alexander’s men fell, not only being
overwhelmed by the multitude of the barbarians, but
also because the Scythians themselves and their horses
were much more completely protected with armour for
guarding their bodies.<a name="FNanchor_413" id="FNanchor_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">413</a> Notwithstanding this, the
Macedonians sustained their assaults, and assailing them
violently squadron by squadron, they succeeded in
pushing them out of rank. Meantime the foreigners
launched their scythe-bearing chariots against Alexander
himself, for the purpose of throwing his phalanx into
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>confusion; but in this they were grievously deceived.
For as soon as some of them approached, the Agrianians
and the javelin-men with Balacrus, who had been posted
in front of the Companion cavalry, hurled their javelins
at them; others they seized by the reins and pulled the
drivers off, and standing round the horses killed them.
Yet some rolled right through the ranks; for the men
stood apart and opened their ranks, as they had been
instructed, in the places where the chariots assaulted
them. In this way it generally happened that the
chariots passed through safely, and the men by whom
they were driven were uninjured. But these also were
afterwards overpowered by the grooms of Alexander’s
army and by the royal shield-bearing guards.<a name="FNanchor_414" id="FNanchor_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">414</a></p>

<hr />

<h3>CHAPTER XIV.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Battle of Arbela.&mdash;Flight of Darius.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">As</span> soon as Darius began to set his whole phalanx in
motion, Alexander ordered Aretes to attack those who
were riding completely round his right wing; and up
to that time he was himself leading his men in column.
But when the Persians had made a break in the front
line of their army, in consequence of the cavalry sallying
forth to assist those who were surrounding the
right wing, Alexander wheeled round towards the gap,
and forming a wedge as it were of the Companion cavalry
and of the part of the phalanx which was posted here,
he led them with a quick charge and loud battle-cry
straight towards Darius himself. For a short time there
ensued a hand-to-hand fight; but when the Macedonian
cavalry, commanded by Alexander himself, pressed on
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>vigorously, thrusting themselves against the Persians
and striking their faces with their spears, and when the
Macedonian phalanx in dense array and bristling<a name="FNanchor_415" id="FNanchor_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">415</a> with
long pikes had also made an attack upon them, all
things at once appeared full of terror to Darius, who
had already long been in a state of fear, so that he was
the first to turn and flee.<a name="FNanchor_416" id="FNanchor_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">416</a> The Persians also who were
riding round the wing were seized with alarm when
Aretes made a vigorous attack upon them. In this
quarter indeed the Persians took to speedy flight; and the
Macedonians followed up the fugitives and slaughtered
them.<a name="FNanchor_417" id="FNanchor_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">417</a> Simmias and his brigade were not yet able to
start with Alexander in pursuit, but causing the phalanx
to halt there, he took part in the struggle, because the
left wing of the Macedonians was reported to be hard
pressed. In this part of the field, their line being
broken, some of the Indians and of the Persian cavalry
burst through the gap towards the baggage of the
Macedonians; and there the action became desperate.
For the Persians fell boldly on the men, who were most
of them unarmed, and never expected that any men
would cut through the double phalanx and break through
upon them.<a name="FNanchor_418" id="FNanchor_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">418</a> When the Persians made this attack, the
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>foreign prisoners also assisted them by falling upon the
Macedonians in the midst of the action. But the commanders
of the men who had been posted as a reserve
to the first phalanx, learning what was taking place,
quickly moved from the position which they had been
ordered to take, and coming upon the Persians in the
rear, killed many of them there collected round the
baggage. But the rest of them gave way and fled. The
Persians on the right wing, who had not yet become
aware of the flight of Darius, rode round Alexander’s
left wing and attacked Parmenio in flank.<a name="FNanchor_419" id="FNanchor_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">419</a></p>

<hr />

<h3>CHAPTER XV.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Defeat of the Persians and Pursuit of Darius.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">At</span> this juncture, while the Macedonians were doubtful
as to the result of the battle, Parmenio sent a messenger
to Alexander in haste, to tell him that their side was
in a critical position and that he must send him aid.<a name="FNanchor_420" id="FNanchor_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">420</a>
When this news was brought to Alexander, he immediately
turned back again from the pursuit, and wheeling
round with the Companion cavalry, led them with great
speed against the right wing of the foreigners. In the
first place he assaulted the fleeing cavalry of the enemy,
the Parthians, some of the Indians, and the most numerous
and the bravest division of the Persians. Then
ensued the most obstinately contested cavalry fight in
the whole engagement. For being drawn up by squadrons
as it were, the foreigners wheeled round and falling
on Alexander’s men face to face, they no longer relied
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>on the hurling of javelins or the dexterous deploying of
horses, as is the common practice in cavalry battles, but
every one on his own account strove eagerly to break
through what stood in his way, as if this were their only
means of safety. They struck and were struck without
quarter, as if they were no longer struggling to secure
the victory for another, but were contending for their
own personal safety. Here about sixty of Alexander’s
Companions fell; and Hephaestion himself, as well as
Coenus and Menidas, was wounded. But even these
troops were overcome by Alexander; and as many of
them as could force their way through his ranks fled
with all their might. And now Alexander had nearly
come into conflict with the enemy’s right wing, but in
the meantime the Thessalian cavalry in a splendid
struggle, had not fallen short of Alexander’s success
in the engagement. For the foreigners on the right
wing were already beginning to fly when he came on
the scene of conflict; so that he wheeled round again
and started off in pursuit of Darius once more, keeping
up the chase as long as there was daylight. Parmenio’s
brigade also followed in pursuit of those who were
opposed to them. But Alexander crossed the river
Lycus<a name="FNanchor_421" id="FNanchor_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">421</a> and pitched his camp there, to give his men and
horses a little rest; while Parmenio seized the Persian
camp with their baggage, elephants, and camels. After
giving his horsemen rest until midnight, Alexander
again advanced by a forced march towards Arbela, with
the hope of seizing Darius there, together with his money
and the rest of his royal property. He reached Arbela
the next day, having pursued altogether about 600 stades
from the battle-field.<a name="FNanchor_422" id="FNanchor_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">422</a> But as Darius went on fleeing

However the money and all the other property were
captured, as was also the chariot of Darius. His spear
and bow were likewise taken, as had been the case after
the battle of Issus.<a name="FNanchor_424" id="FNanchor_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">424</a> Of Alexander’s men about 100
were killed, and more than 1,000 of his horses were lost
either from wounds or from fatigue in the pursuit, nearly
half of them belonging to the Companion cavalry. Of
the foreigners there were said to have been about
300,000 slain, and far more were taken prisoners than
were killed.<a name="FNanchor_425" id="FNanchor_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">425</a> The elephants and all the chariots which
had not been destroyed in the battle were also captured.
Such was the result of this battle, which was fought in
the archonship of Aristophanes at Athens, in the month
Pyanepsion;<a name="FNanchor_426" id="FNanchor_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">426</a> and thus Aristander’s prediction was
accomplished, that Alexander would both fight a battle
and gain a victory in the same month in which the
moon was seen to be eclipsed.<a name="FNanchor_427" id="FNanchor_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">427</a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVI.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Escape of Darius into Media.&mdash;March of Alexander
to Babylon and Susa.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Immediately</span> after the battle, Darius marched through
the mountains of Armenia towards Media, accompanied
in his flight by the Bactrian cavalry, as they had then
been posted with him in the battle; also by those
Persians who were called the king’s kinsmen, and by
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>a few of the men called apple-bearers.<a name="FNanchor_428" id="FNanchor_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">428</a> About 2,000 of
his Grecian mercenaries also accompanied him in his
flight, under the command of Paron the Phocian, and
Glaucus the Aetolian. He fled towards Media for this
reason, because he thought Alexander would take the
road to Susa and Babylon immediately after the battle,
inasmuch as the whole of that country was inhabited
and the road was not difficult for the transit of baggage;
and besides Babylon and Susa appeared to be the prizes
of the war; whereas the road towards Media was by no
means easy for the march of a large army. In this conjecture
Darius was mistaken; for when Alexander started
from Arbela, he advanced straight towards Babylon;
and when he was now not far from that city, he drew
up his army in order of battle and marched forward.
The Babylonians came out to meet him in mass, with
their priests and rulers, each of whom individually
brought gifts, and offered to surrender their city, citadel,
and money.<a name="FNanchor_429" id="FNanchor_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">429</a> Entering the city, he commanded the
Babylonians to rebuild all the temples which Xerxes
had destroyed, and especially that of Belus, whom the
Babylonians venerate more than any other god.<a name="FNanchor_430" id="FNanchor_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">430</a> He
then appointed Mazaeus viceroy of the Babylonians,
Apollodorus the Amphipolitan general of the soldiers
who were left behind with Mazaeus, and Asclepiodorus,
son of Philo, collector of the revenue. He also sent
Mithrines, who had surrendered to him the citadel of
Sardis, down into Armenia to be viceroy there.<a name="FNanchor_431" id="FNanchor_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">431</a> Here
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>also he met with the Chaldaeans; and whatever they
directed in regard to the religious rites of Babylon he
performed, and in particular he offered sacrifice to Belus
according to their instructions.<a name="FNanchor_432" id="FNanchor_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">432</a> He then marched away
to Susa<a name="FNanchor_433" id="FNanchor_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">433</a>; and on the way he was met by the son of the
viceroy of the Susians,<a name="FNanchor_434" id="FNanchor_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">434</a> and a man bearing a letter from
Philoxenus, whom he had despatched to Susa directly
after the battle. In the letter Philoxenus had written
that the Susians had surrendered their city to him, and
that all the money was safe for Alexander. In twenty
days the king arrived at Susa from Babylon; and entering
the city he took possession of the money, which
amounted to 50,000 talents, as well as the rest of the
royal property.<a name="FNanchor_435" id="FNanchor_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">435</a> Many other things were also captured
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>there, which Xerxes brought with him from Greece,
especially the brazen statues of Harmodius and Aristogeiton.<a name="FNanchor_436" id="FNanchor_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">436</a>
These Alexander sent back to the Athenians,
and they are now standing at Athens in the Ceramicus,
where we go up into the Acropolis,<a name="FNanchor_437" id="FNanchor_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">437</a> right opposite the
temple of Rhea, the mother of the gods, not far from the
altar of the Eudanemi. Whoever has been initiated in the
mysteries of the two goddesses<a name="FNanchor_438" id="FNanchor_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">438</a> at Eleusis, knows the
altar of Eudanemus which is upon the plain. At Susa
Alexander offered sacrifice after the custom of his fathers,
and celebrated a torch race and a gymnastic contest;
and then, leaving Abulites, a Persian, as viceroy of
Susiana, Mazarus, one of his Companions, as commander
of the garrison in the citadel of Susa, and Archelaüs, son
of Theodorus, as general, he advanced towards the land
of the Persians. He also sent Menes down to the sea,
as governor of Syria, Phœnicia, and Cilicia, giving
him 3,000 talents of silver<a name="FNanchor_439" id="FNanchor_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">439</a> to convey to the sea, with
orders to despatch as many of them to Antipater as he
might need to carry on the war against the Lacedaemonians.<a name="FNanchor_440" id="FNanchor_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">440</a>
There also Amyntas, son of Andromenes,
reached him with the forces which he was leading from
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>Macedonia<a name="FNanchor_441" id="FNanchor_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">441</a>; of whom Alexander placed the horsemen
in the ranks of the Companion cavalry, and the foot he
added to the various regiments of infantry, arranging
each according to nationalities. He also established two
companies in each squadron of cavalry, whereas before
this time companies did not exist in the cavalry; and
over them he set as captains those of the Companions
who were pre-eminent for merit.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER XVII.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Subjugation of the Uxians.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">He</span> now set out from Susa, and, crossing the river
Pasitigris,<a name="FNanchor_442" id="FNanchor_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">442</a> invaded the country of the Uxians. Some
of these people who inhabit the plains were under the
rule of the viceroy of the Persians, and on this occasion
surrendered to Alexander; but those who are called the
mountaineers were not in subjection to the Persians, and
at this time sent word to Alexander that they would not
permit him to march with his forces into Persis, unless
they received from him as much as they were in the habit
of receiving from the king of the Persians for the passage
through their mountains.<a name="FNanchor_443" id="FNanchor_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">443</a> He sent the messengers back
with instructions to come to the defiles, the possession of
which made them think that the passage into Persis was
in their power, promising them that they should there
receive from him the prescribed toll. He then took the
royal body-guards, the shield-bearing infantry, and 8,000
men from the rest of his army, and, under the guidance
of the Susians, marched by night along a different road
from the frequented one. Advancing by a route rough
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>and difficult, on the same day he fell upon the villages
of the Uxians, where he captured much booty and killed
many of the people while still in their beds; but others
escaped into the mountains. He then made a forced march
to the defiles, where the Uxians resolved to meet him in
mass in order to receive the prescribed toll. But he
had already previously despatched Craterus to seize the
heights, to which he thought the Uxians would retire if
they were repelled by force; and he himself went, with
great celerity, and got possession of the pass before their
arrival. He then drew up his men in battle array, and
led them from the higher and more commanding position
against the barbarians. They, being alarmed at Alexander’s
celerity, and finding themselves deprived by stratagem<a name="FNanchor_444" id="FNanchor_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">444</a>
of the position in which they had especially
confided, took to flight without ever coming to close
combat. Some of them were killed by Alexander’s men
in their flight, and many lost their lives by falling over
the precipices along the road; but most of them fled up
into the mountains for refuge, and falling in with Craterus,
were destroyed by his men. Having received these
gifts of honour<a name="FNanchor_445" id="FNanchor_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">445</a> from Alexander, they with difficulty,
after much entreaty, procured from him the privilege of
retaining possession of their own land on condition of
paying him an annual tribute. Ptolemy, son of Lagus,
says that the mother of Darius,<a name="FNanchor_446" id="FNanchor_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">446</a> on their behalf, entreated
Alexander to grant them the privilege of inhabiting the
land. The tribute agreed upon was a hundred horses,
five hundred oxen, and 30,000 sheep a year; for the
Uxians had no money, nor was their country fit for tillage;
but most of them were shepherds and herdsmen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span></p><h3>CHAPTER XVIII.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Defeat of Ariobarzanes and Capture of Persepolis.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">After</span> this, Alexander despatched Parmenio with the
baggage, the Thessalian cavalry, the Grecian allies, the
mercenary auxiliaries, and the rest of the more heavily
armed soldiers, to march into Persis along the carriage
road leading into that country. He himself took the
Macedonian infantry, the Companion cavalry, the light
cavalry used for skirmishing, the Agrianians, and the
archers, and made a forced march through the mountains.
But when he arrived at the Persian Gates, he found
that Ariobarzanes, the viceroy of Persis, with 40,000
infantry and 700 cavalry, had built a wall across the
pass, and had pitched his camp there near the wall to
block Alexander’s passage. Then indeed he pitched his
camp there; but next day he marshalled his army, and led
it up to the wall. When it was evident that it would be
difficult to capture it on account of the rugged nature of
the ground, and as many of his men were being wounded,
the enemy assailing them with missiles from engines of
war placed upon higher ground, which gave them an
advantage over their assailants, he retreated to his camp.
He was informed by the prisoners that they could lead
him round by another route, so that he might get to the
other end of the pass; but when he ascertained that this
road was rough and narrow, he left Craterus there at the
camp with his own brigade and that of Meleager, as well
as a few archers and 500 cavalry, with orders that when
he perceived he had got right round and was approaching
the camp of the Persians (which he could easily perceive,
because the trumpets would give him the signal),
he should then assault the wall. Alexander advanced by
night, and travelling about 100 stades, he took the
shield-bearing guards, the brigade of Perdiccas, the
lightest armed of the archers, the Agrianians, the royal<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
squadron of cavalry Companions, and one regiment of
cavalry besides these, containing four companies; and
wheeling round with these troops, he marched towards
the pass in the direction the prisoners led him. He
ordered Amyntas, Philotas, and Coenus to lead the rest
of the army towards the plain, and to make a bridge over
the river<a name="FNanchor_447" id="FNanchor_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">447</a> which one must cross to go into Persis. He
himself went by a route difficult and rough, along which
he nevertheless marched for the most part at full speed.
Falling upon the first guard of the barbarians before
daylight,<a name="FNanchor_448" id="FNanchor_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">448</a> he destroyed them, and so be did most of the
second; but the majority of the third guard escaped,
not indeed by fleeing into the camp of Ariobarzanes, but
into the mountains as they were, being seized with a
sudden panic. Consequently He fell upon the enemy’s
camp at the approach of dawn without being observed.
At the very time he began to assault the trench, the
trumpets gave the signal to Craterus, who at once
attacked the advanced fortification. The enemy then,
being in a state of confusion from being attacked on all
sides, fled without coming to close conflict; but they
were hemmed in on all hands, Alexander pressing upon
them in one direction and the men of Craterus running
up in another. Therefore most of them were compelled
to wheel round and flee into the fortifications, which
were already in the hands of the Macedonians. For
Alexander, expecting the very thing which really occurred,
had left Ptolemy there with three thousand
infantry; so that most of the barbarians were cut to
pieces by the Macedonians at close quarters. Others
perished in the terrible flight which ensued, hurling
themselves over the precipices; but Ariobarzanes him<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>self,
with a few horsemen, escaped into the mountains.<a name="FNanchor_449" id="FNanchor_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">449</a></p>

<p>Alexander now marched back with all speed to the
river, and finding the bridge already constructed over it,
he easily crossed with his army.<a name="FNanchor_450" id="FNanchor_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">450</a> Thence he again continued
his march to Persepolis, so that he arrived before
the guards of the city could pillage the treasury.<a name="FNanchor_451" id="FNanchor_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">451</a> He
also captured the money which was at Pasargadae<a name="FNanchor_452" id="FNanchor_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">452</a> in
the treasury of the first Cyrus, and appointed Phrasaortes,
son of Rheomithres, viceroy over the Persians. He burnt
down the Persian palace, though Parmenio advised him
to preserve it, for many reasons, and especially because
it was not well to destroy what was now his own property,
and because the men of Asia would not by this
course of action be induced to come over to him, thinking
that he himself had decided not to retain the rule of
Asia, but only to conquer it and depart. But Alexander
said that he wished to take vengeance on the Persians,
in retaliation for their deeds in the invasion of Greece,
when they razed Athens to the ground and burnt down
the temples. He also desired to punish the Persians for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>all the other injuries they had done the Greeks. But
Alexander does not seem to me to have acted on this
occasion with prudence; nor do I think that this was
any retributive penalty at all on the ancient Persians.<a name="FNanchor_453" id="FNanchor_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">453</a></p>

<hr />

<h3>CHAPTER XIX.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Darius Pursued into Media and Parthia.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">After</span> bringing these matters to a successful issue, he
advanced towards Media; for he ascertained that Darius
was there. Now Darius had formed the resolution, if
Alexander remained at Susa or Babylon, to stay there
among the Medes, in order to see if any change of policy
were made by Alexander. But if the latter marched
against him, he resolved to proceed into the interior
towards Parthia and Hyrcania, as far as Bactria, laying
waste all the land and making it impossible for Alexander
to advance any further. He therefore sent the women
and the rest of the property which he still retained, together
with the covered carriages, to what were called
the Caspian Gates<a name="FNanchor_454" id="FNanchor_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">454</a>; but he himself stayed at Ecbatana,<a name="FNanchor_455" id="FNanchor_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">455</a>
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>with the forces which had been collected from those who
were at hand. Hearing this, Alexander advanced towards
Media, and invading the land of the Paraetacae,<a name="FNanchor_456" id="FNanchor_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">456</a> he
subdued it, and appointed Oxathres, son of Abulites, the
former viceroy of Susa, to rule as viceroy. Being informed
on the march that Darius had determined to meet
him for battle, and to try the fortune of war again (for
the Scythians and Cadusians had come to him as allies),
he ordered that the beasts of burden, with their guards
and the rest of the baggage, should follow; and taking
the rest of his army, he led it in order of battle, and on
the twelfth day arrived in Media. There he ascertained
that the forces of Darius were not fit for battle, and that
his allies, the Cadusians and Scythians, had not arrived;
but that he had resolved to flee. He therefore marched
on with still greater speed; and when he was only three
days’ journey from Ecbatana, he was met by Bistanes,
son of Ochus, who reigned over the Persians before
Darius. This man announced that Darius had fled five
days before, taking with him 7,000 talents of money<a name="FNanchor_457" id="FNanchor_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">457</a>
from the Medes, and an army of 3,000 cavalry and 6,000
infantry.</p>

<p>When Alexander reached Ecbatana, be sent the Thessalian
cavalry and the other Grecian allies back to the
sea, paying them the full hire which had been stipulated,
and making them an additional donation from himself of
2,000 talents. He issued an order that if any man of
his own accord wished still to continue to serve for hire
with him, he should enlist; and those who enlisted in
his service were not a few. He then ordered Epocillus,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>son of Polyeides, to conduct the rest down to the sea,
taking other cavalry as a guard for them, since the
Thessalians sold their horses there. He also sent word
to Menes to take upon himself the duty of seeing that
they were conveyed in triremes to Euboea, when they
arrived at the sea.<a name="FNanchor_458" id="FNanchor_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">458</a> He instructed Parmenio to deposit
the money which was being conveyed from Persis in the
citadel at Ecbatana, and to band it over to the charge of
Harpalus;<a name="FNanchor_459" id="FNanchor_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">459</a> for he had left this man over the money
with a guard of 6,000 Macedonians and a few horsemen
and light-armed infantry to take care of it. He told
Parmenio himself to take the Grecian mercenaries, the
Thracians, and all the other horsemen except the Companion
cavalry, and march by the land of the Cadusians
into Hyrcania. He also sent word to Clitus, the commander
of the royal squadron of cavalry, who had been
left behind at Susa ill, that when he arrived at Ecbatana
from Susa he should take the Macedonians who had been
left there in charge of the money, and go in the direction
of Parthia, where also he himself intended soon to arrive.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER XX.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">March through the Caspian Gates.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Then</span> taking the Companion cavalry, the light cavalry
used for skirmishing, the Greek mercenary cavalry, under
the command of Erigyius, the Macedonian phalanx,
except the men who had been placed in charge of the
money, the archers, and the Agrianians, he marched
against Darius. In the forced march which he made,
many of his soldiers were left behind, worn out with
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>fatigue, and many of the horses died. He nevertheless
pressed on, and on the eleventh day arrived at Rhagae.<a name="FNanchor_460" id="FNanchor_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">460</a>
This place is distant from the Caspian Gates one day’s
journey to one marching as Alexander did. But Darius
had already passed through this defile before Alexander
came up, though many of those who were his companions
in flight deserted him on the way and retired to their
own abodes. Many also surrendered to Alexander.
The latter now gave up the hope of capturing Darius by
close pursuit, and remained there five days to give his
troops repose. He appointed Oxodates a Persian, who
had the ill fortune to be arrested by Darius and shut up
at Susa, to the office of viceroy of Media; for this treatment
was an inducement to Alexander to rely on his
fidelity. He then marched towards Parthia; and on the
first day encamped near the Caspian Gates, which he
passed through on the second day as far as the country
was inhabited.<a name="FNanchor_461" id="FNanchor_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">461</a> Hearing that the country further on
was desert, he resolved to procure a stock of provisions
from the place where he was encamped, and accordingly
sent Coenus out on a foraging expedition with the cavalry
and a small body of infantry.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER XXI.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Darius is Assassinated by Bessus.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">At</span> this time Bagistanes, one of the Babylonian nobles,
came to him from the camp of Darius, accompanied by
Antibelus, one of the sons of Mazaeus. These men
informed him that Nabarzanes, the commander of the
cavalry which accompanied Darius in his flight, Bessus,
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>viceroy of Bactria, and Barsaëntes, viceroy of the Arachotians
and Drangians,<a name="FNanchor_462" id="FNanchor_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">462</a> had jointly arrested the king.
When Alexander heard this, he marched with still
greater speed than ever, taking with him only the
Companions and the skirmishing cavalry, as well as some
of the foot-soldiers selected as the strongest and lightest
men. He did not even wait for Coenus to return from
the foraging expedition; but placed Craterus over the
men left behind, with instructions to follow in short
marches. His own men took with them nothing but
their arms and provisions for two days. After marching
the whole night and till noon of the next day, he gave
his army a short rest, then went on again all night, and
when day began to break reached the camp from which
Bagistanes had set out to meet him; but he did not
catch the enemy. However, in regard to Darius, he
ascertained that be had been arrested and was being
conveyed in a covered carriage<a name="FNanchor_463" id="FNanchor_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">463</a>; that Bessus possessed
the command instead of Darius, and had been nominated
leader by the Bactrian cavalry and all the other barbarians
who were companions of Darius in his flight, except
Artabazus and his sons, together with the Grecian
mercenaries, who still remained faithful to Darius; but
they, not being able to prevent what was being done, had
turned aside their march from the public thoroughfare
and were marching towards the mountains by themselves,
refusing to take part with Bessus and his adherents
in their enterprise. He also learnt that those
who had arrested Darius had come to the decision to
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>surrender him to Alexander, and to procure some advantage
for themselves, if they should find that Alexander
was pursuing them; but if they should learn that he had
gone back again, they had resolved to collect as large
an army as they could and to preserve the rule for the
commonwealth. He also ascertained that for the present
Bessus held the supreme command, both on account
of his relationship to Darius and because the war was
being carried on in his viceregal province. Hearing this,
Alexander thought it was advisable to pursue with all
his might; and though his men and horses were already
quite fatigued by the incessant severity of their labours,
he nevertheless proceeded, and, travelling a long way all
through the night and the next day till noon, arrived at
a certain village, where those who were leading Darius
had encamped the day before. Hearing there that the
barbarians had decided to continue their march by night,
he inquired of the natives if they knew any shorter road
to the fugitives. They said they did know one, but that
it ran through a country which was desert through lack
of water. He nevertheless ordered them to show him
this way, and perceiving that the infantry could not keep
up with him if he marched at full speed, he caused 500
of the cavalry to dismount from their horses; and selecting
the officers of the infantry and the best of the other
foot-soldiers, he ordered them to mount the horses
armed just as they were. He also directed Nicanor, the
commander of the shield-bearing guards, and Attalus,
commander of the Agrianians, to lead their men who
were left behind, by the same route which Bessus had
taken, having equipped them as lightly as possible; and
he ordered that the rest of the infantry should follow in
regular marching order. He himself began to march
in the afternoon, and led the way with great rapidity.<a name="FNanchor_464" id="FNanchor_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">464</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
Having travelled 400 stades in the night, he came upon
the barbarians just before daybreak, going along without
any order and unarmed; so that few of them rushed to
defend themselves, but most of them, as soon as they saw
Alexander himself, took to flight without even coming
to blows. A few of those who turned to resist being
killed, the rest of these also took to flight. Up to this
time Bessus and his adherents were still conveying
Darius with them in a covered carriage; but when
Alexander was already close upon their heels Nabarzanes
and Barsaëntes wounded him and left him there, and
with 600 horsemen took to flight. Darius died from his
wounds soon after, before Alexander had seen him.<a name="FNanchor_465" id="FNanchor_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">465</a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXII.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Reflections on the Fate of Darius.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Alexander</span> sent the body of Darius into Persis, with
orders that it should be buried in the royal sepulchre, in
the same way as the other Persian kings before him
had been buried.<a name="FNanchor_466" id="FNanchor_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">466</a> He then proclaimed Amminaspes, a
Parthian, viceroy over the Parthians and Hyrcanians.
This man was one of those who with Mazaces had surrendered
Egypt to Alexander. He also appointed Tlepolemus,
son of Pythophanes, one of the Companions,
to guard his interests in Parthia and Hyrcania. Such
was the end of Darius, in the archonship of Aristophon
at Athens, in the month Hecatombaion.<a name="FNanchor_467" id="FNanchor_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">467</a> This king was
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>a man pre-eminently effeminate and lacking in self-reliance
in military enterprises; but as to civil matters
he never exhibited any disposition to indulge in arbitrary
conduct; nor indeed was it in his power to exhibit it.
For it happened that he was involved in a war with the
Macedonians and Greeks at the very time he succeeded
to the regal power<a name="FNanchor_468" id="FNanchor_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">468</a>; and consequently it was no longer
possible for him to act the tyrant towards his subjects,
even if he had been so inclined, standing as he did in
greater danger than they. As long as he lived, one
misfortune after another was accumulated upon him; nor
did he experience any cessation of calamity from the
time when he first succeeded to the rule. At the beginning
of his reign the cavalry defeat was sustained by
his viceroys at the Granicus, and forthwith Ionia
Aeolis, both the Phrygias, Lydia, and all Caria<a name="FNanchor_469" id="FNanchor_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">469</a> except
Halicarnassus were occupied by his foe; soon after,
Halicarnassus also was captured, as well as all the littoral
as far as Cilicia. Then came his own discomfiture at
Issus, where he saw his mother, wife, and children taken
prisoners. Upon this Phoenicia and the whole of Egypt
were lost; and then at Arbela he himself fled disgracefully
among the first, and lost a very vast army composed
of all the nations of his empire. After this, wandering
as an exile from his own dominions, he died after being
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>betrayed by his personal attendants to the worst treatment
possible, being at the same time king and a prisoner
ignominiously led in chains; and at last he perished
through a conspiracy formed of those most intimately
acquainted with him. Such were the misfortunes that
befell Darius in his lifetime; but after his death he
received a royal burial; his children received from
Alexander a princely rearing and education, just as if
their father had still been king; and Alexander himself
became his son-in-law.<a name="FNanchor_470" id="FNanchor_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">470</a> When he died he was about
fifty years of age.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER XXIII.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Expedition into Hyrcania.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Alexander</span> now took the soldiers who had been left
behind in his pursuit and advanced into Hyrcania,<a name="FNanchor_471" id="FNanchor_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">471</a> which
is the country lying on the left of the road leading to
Bactra.<a name="FNanchor_472" id="FNanchor_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">472</a> On one side it is bounded by lofty mountains
densely covered with wood, and on the other it is a plain
stretching as far as the Great Sea<a name="FNanchor_473" id="FNanchor_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">473</a> in this part of the
world. He led his army by this route, because he
ascertained that the Grecian mercenaries serving under
Darius had succeeded in escaping by it into the mountains
of Tapuria; at the same time he resolved to subdue
the Tapurians themselves. Having divided his army
into three parts, he himself led the way by the shortest
and most difficult route, at the head of the most numerous
and at the same time the lightest division of his
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>forces. He despatched Craterus at the head of his own
brigade and that of Amyntas, some of the archers, and
a few of the cavalry against the Tapurians; and he
ordered Erigyius to take the Grecian mercenaries and
the rest of the cavalry, and lead the way by the public
thoroughfare, though it was longer, conducting the
waggons, the baggage, and the crowd of camp-followers.
After crossing the first mountains, and encamping there,
he took the shield-bearing guards together with the
lightest men in the Macedonian phalanx and some of
the archers, and went along a road difficult and hard to
travel upon, leaving guards for the roads wherever he
thought there was any peril, so that the barbarians who
held the mountains might not at those points fall upon
the men who were following. Having passed through
the defiles with his archers, he encamped in the plain
near a small river<a name="FNanchor_474" id="FNanchor_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">474</a>; and while he was here, Nabarzanes,
the commander of Darius’s cavalry, Phrataphernes, the
viceroy of Hyrcania and Parthia, and the other most
distinguished of the Persians in attendance on Darius,
arrived and surrendered themselves. After waiting four
days in the camp, he took up those who had been left
behind on the march, all of them advancing in safety
except the Agrianians, who, while guarding the rear,
were attacked by the barbarian mountaineers. But these
soon drew off when they got the worst of it in the
skirmish. Starting from this place, he advanced into
Hyrcania as far as Zadracarta, the capital of the Hyrcanians.
In this place<a name="FNanchor_475" id="FNanchor_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">475</a> he was rejoined by Craterus, who
had not succeeded in falling in with the Grecian mercenaries
of Darius; but he had thoroughly traversed the
whole country, gaining over part of it by force and the
other part by the voluntary capitulation of the inhabit<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>ants.
Erigyius also arrived here with the baggage and
waggons; and soon after Artabazus<a name="FNanchor_476" id="FNanchor_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">476</a> came to Alexander
with three of his sons, Cophen, Ariobarzanes, and
Arsames, accompanied by Autophradates, viceroy of
Tapuria, and envoys from the Grecian mercenaries in
the service of Darius. To Autophradates he restored
his viceregal office; but Artabazus and his sons he kept
near himself in a position of honour, both on account of
their fidelity to Darius and because they were among
the first nobles of Persia. To the envoys from the
Greeks, begging him to make a truce with them on
behalf of the whole mercenary force, he replied that he
would not make any agreement with them; because they
were acting with great guilt in serving as soldiers on
the side of the barbarians against Greece, in contravention
of the resolution of the Greeks. He commanded
them to come in a body and surrender, leaving it to him
to treat them as he pleased, or to preserve themselves
as best they could. The envoys said that they yielded
both themselves and their comrades to Alexander, and
urged him to send some one with them to act as their
leader, so that they might be conducted to him with
safety. They said they were 1,500 in number. Accordingly
he sent Andronicus, son of Agerrhus, and Artabazus
to them.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER XXIV.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Expedition against the Mardians.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">He</span> then marched forward against the Mardians<a name="FNanchor_477" id="FNanchor_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">477</a> taking
with him the shield-bearing guards, the archers, the
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>Agrianians, the brigades of Coenus and Amyntas, half of
the Companion cavalry, and the horse-lancers; for he had
now a troop of horse-lancers. Traversing the greater
part of the land of the Mardians, he killed many of them
in their flight, some indeed having turned to defend
themselves; and many were taken prisoners. No one
for a long time had invaded their land in a hostile
manner, not only on account of its ruggedness, but also
because the people were poor, and besides being poor
were warlike. Therefore they never feared that Alexander
would attack them, especially as he had already
advanced further than their country. For this reason
they were caught more easily off their guard. Many
of them, however, escaped into the mountains, which
in their land are very lofty and craggy, thinking that
Alexander would not penetrate to these at any rate.
But when he was approaching them even here, they sent
envoys to surrender both the people and their land to
him. He pardoned them, and appointed Autophradates,
whom he had also recently placed over the Tapurians,
viceroy over them. Returning to the camp, from which
he had started to invade the country of the Mardians, he
found that the Grecian mercenaries of Darius had arrived,
accompanied by the envoys from the Lacedaemonians
who were on an embassy to king Darius. The names
of these men were, Callicratidas, Pausippus, Monimus,
Onomas, and Dropides, a man from Athens. These were
arrested and kept under guard; but he released the
envoys from the Sinopeans,<a name="FNanchor_478" id="FNanchor_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">478</a> because these people had
no share in the commonwealth of the Greeks; and as
they were in subjection to the Persians, they did not
seem to be doing anything unreasonable in going on an
embassy to their own king. He also released the rest of
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>the Greeks who were serving for pay with the Persians
before the peace and alliance which had been made by
the Greeks with the Macedonians. He likewise released
Heraclides, the ambassador from the Chalcedonians<a name="FNanchor_479" id="FNanchor_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">479</a> to
Darius. The rest he ordered to serve in his army for the
same pay as they had received from the Persian king,
putting them under the command of Andronicus, who
had led them, and had evidently been taking prudent
measures to save the lives of the men.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER XXV.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">March to Bactra.&mdash;Bessus Aided by Satibarzanes.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Having</span> settled these affairs, he marched to Zadracarta,
the largest city of Hyrcania, where also was the seat of
the Hyrcanian government. Tarrying here fifteen days,
he offered sacrifice to the gods according to his custom,
and celebrated a gymnastic contest, after which he
began his march towards Parthia; thence to the confines
of Areia<a name="FNanchor_480" id="FNanchor_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">480</a> and to Susia, a city in that province,
where Satibarzanes, the viceroy of the Areians, came to
meet him. To this man he restored his viceregal dignity,
and with him sent Anaxippus, one of the Companions, to
whom he gave forty horse-lancers so that he might be
able to station them as guards of the localities, in order
that the Areians might not be injured by the army in
its march through their land. At this time came to
him some Persians, who informed him that Bessus had
assumed the erect tiara<a name="FNanchor_481" id="FNanchor_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">481</a> and was wearing the Persian
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>dress,<a name="FNanchor_482" id="FNanchor_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">482</a> calling himself Artaxerxes instead of Bessus, and
asserting that he was king of Asia. They said he had
in attendance upon him the Persians who had escaped
into Bactra and many of the Bactrians themselves; and
that he was expecting the Scythians also to come to him
as allies. Alexander, having now all his forces together,
went towards Bactra, where Philip son of Menelaüs came
to him out of Media with the Greek mercenary cavalry
which were under his own command, those of the Thessalians
who had volunteered to remain, and the men of
Andromachus. Nicanor, the son of Parmenio, the commander
of the shield-bearing guards, had already died
of disease. While Alexander was on his way to Bactra,
he was informed that Satibarzanes, viceroy of Areia, had
killed Anaxippus and the horse-lancers who were with
him, had armed the Areians and collected them in the
city of Artacoana, which was the capital of that nation.
It was also said that he had resolved, as soon as he
ascertained that Alexander had advanced, to leave that
place and go with his forces to Bessus, with the intention
of joining that prince in an attack upon the
Macedonians, wherever a chance might occur. When
he received this news, he stopped the march towards
Bactra, and taking with him the Companion cavalry, the
horse-lancers, the archers, the Agrianians and the regiments
of Amyntas and Coenus, and leaving the rest of
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>his forces there under the command of Craterus, he
made a forced march against Satibarzanes and the
Areians; and having travelled 600 stades in two days
came near Artacoana. Satibarzanes, however, no sooner
perceived that Alexander was near, than being struck
with terror at the quickness of his arrival, he took to
flight with a few Areian horsemen. For he was deserted
by the majority of his soldiers in his flight, when they
also learned that Alexander was at hand. The latter
made rapid marches in pursuit of the enemy, killed some
of the men whom he discovered to be guilty of the revolt
and who at that time had left their villages, fleeing, some
one way, some another; and others of them he sold into
slavery. He then proclaimed Arsames, a Persian, viceroy
over the Areians. Being now joined by the men who
had been left behind with Craterus, he marched into the
land of the Zarangaeans,<a name="FNanchor_483" id="FNanchor_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">483</a> and reached the place where
their seat of government was. But Barsaëntes, who at
that time had possession of the land, being one of those
who had fallen upon Darius in his flight, learning that
Alexander was approaching, fled to the Indians who live
this side of the river Indus. But they arrested him and
sent him back to Alexander, by whom he was put to
death on account of his guilty conduct towards Darius.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER XXVI.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Philotas and Parmenio put to Death.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Here</span> also Alexander discovered the conspiracy of
Philōtas, son of Parmenio. Ptolemy and Aristobūlus
say that it had already been reported to him before in
Egypt<a name="FNanchor_484" id="FNanchor_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">484</a>; but that it did not appear to him credible, both
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>on account of the long-existing friendship between them,
the honour which he publicly conferred upon his father
Parmenio, and the confidence he reposed in Philotas
himself. Ptolemy, son of Lagus, says that Philotas was
brought before the Macedonians,<a name="FNanchor_485" id="FNanchor_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">485</a> that Alexander vehemently
accused him, and that he defended himself
from the charges. He says also that the divulgers<a name="FNanchor_486" id="FNanchor_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">486</a> of
the plot came forward and convicted him and his accomplices
both by other clear proofs and especially because
Philotas himself confessed that he had heard of a certain
conspiracy which was being formed against Alexander.
He was convicted of having said nothing to the king
about this plot, though he visited the royal tent twice a
day.<a name="FNanchor_487" id="FNanchor_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">487</a> He and all the others who had taken part with
him in the conspiracy were killed by the Macedonians
with their javelins;<a name="FNanchor_488" id="FNanchor_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">488</a> and Polydamas, one of the Companions,
was despatched to Parmenio, carrying letters
from Alexander to the generals in Media, Cleander,
Sitalces, and Menidas, who had been placed over the
army commanded by Parmenio. By these men Parmenio
was put to death, perhaps because Alexander deemed it
incredible that Philotas should conspire against him and
Parmenio not participate in his son’s plan; or perhaps,
he thought that even if he had no share in it, he would
now be a dangerous man if he survived, after the king
had violently made away with his son. Moreover he was
held in very great respect both by Alexander himself
and by all the army, having great influence not only
among the Macedonian troops but also among the
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>Grecian auxiliaries, whom he often used to command
according to Alexander’s order, both in his own turn and
out of his turn, with his sovereign’s approbation and
satisfaction.<a name="FNanchor_489" id="FNanchor_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">489</a></p>

<hr />

<h3>CHAPTER XXVII.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Treatment of Amyntas.&mdash;The Ariaspians.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">They</span> also say that about the same time Amyntas, son
of Andromenes, was brought to trial, together with his
brothers Polemo, Attalus, and Simmias, on the charge
of being accessory to the conspiracy against Alexander,
on account of their trust in Philotas and their intimate
friendship with him. The belief in their participation
in the plot was strengthened among the mass of men by
the fact that when Philotas was arrested, Polemo, one
of the brothers of Amyntas, fled to the enemy. But
Amyntas with his other two brothers stayed to await
the trial, and defended himself so vigorously among the
Macedonians that he was declared innocent of the charge.
As soon as he was acquitted in the assembly, he demanded
that permission should be given him to go to
his brother and bring him back to Alexander. To this
the Macedonians acceded; so he went away and on the
same day brought Polemo back. On this account he
now seemed free from guilt much more than before.
But soon after, as he was besieging a certain village, he
was shot with an arrow and died of the wound; so that
he derived no other advantage from his acquittal except
that of dying with an unsullied reputation.<a name="FNanchor_490" id="FNanchor_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">490</a></p>

<p>Alexander appointed two commanders over the Companion
cavalry, Hephaestion, son of Amyntor, and Clitus,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>son of Dropidas, dividing the brigade of the Companions
into two parts, because he did not wish any one of his
friends to have the sole command of so many horsemen,
especially as they were the best of all his cavalry, both
in public estimation and in martial discipline.<a name="FNanchor_491" id="FNanchor_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">491</a> He
now arrived in the land of the people formerly called
Ariaspians, but afterwards named Euergetae, because
they assisted Cyrus, son of Cambyses, in his invasion of
Scythia.<a name="FNanchor_492" id="FNanchor_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">492</a> Alexander treated these people, whose ancestors
had been serviceable to Cyrus, with honour; and
when he ascertained that the men not only enjoyed a form
of government unlike that of the other barbarians in that
part of the world, but laid claim to justice equally with
the best of the Greeks, he set them free, and gave them
besides as much of the adjacent country as they asked
for themselves; but they did not ask for much. Here
he offered sacrifice to Apollo, and arrested Demetrius,
one of his confidential body-guards, on suspicion of
having been implicated with Philotas in the conspiracy.
Ptolemy, son of Lagus, was appointed to the post vacated
by Demetrius.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Alexander Crosses the Hindu-Koosh.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">After</span> the transaction of this business, he advanced
against Bactra and Bessus, reducing the Drangians and
Gadrosians<a name="FNanchor_493" id="FNanchor_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">493</a> to subjection on his march. He also re<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>duced
the Arachotians to subjection and appointed
Menon viceroy over them. He then reached the Indians,
who inhabit the land bordering on that of the Arachotians.
All these nations he reached marching through
deep snow and his soldiers experiencing scarcity of provisions
and severe hardship. Learning that the Areians
had again revolted, in consequence of Satibarzanes invading
their land with 2,000 cavalry, which he had
received from Bessus, he despatched against them Artabazus
the Persian with Erigyius and Caranus two of the
Companions, also ordering Phrataphernes, viceroy of the
Parthians, to assist them in attacking the Areians. An
obstinately contested battle then took place between the
troops of Erigyius and Caranus and those of Satibarzanes;
nor did the barbarians give way until Satibarzanes, encountering
Erigyius, was struck in the face with a spear
and killed. Then the barbarians gave way and fled with
headlong speed.</p>

<p>Meantime Alexander was leading his army towards
Mount Caucasus,<a name="FNanchor_494" id="FNanchor_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">494</a> where he founded a city and named it
Alexandreia.<a name="FNanchor_495" id="FNanchor_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">495</a> Having offered sacrifice here to the gods
to whom it was his custom to sacrifice, he crossed Mount
Caucasus, after appointing Proëxes, a Persian, viceroy
over the land, and leaving Neiloxenus son of Satyrus,
one of the Companions, with an army as superintendent.
According to the account of Aristobulus, Mount Caucasus
is as lofty as any in Asia, and most of it is bare, at any
rate in that part where Alexander crossed it. This
range of mountains stretches out so far that they say
even that Mount Taurus, which forms the boundary of
Cilicia and Pamphylia, springs from it, as do other great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>ranges which have been distinguished from the Caucasus
by various names according to the position of each.
Aristobulus says that in this part of the Caucasus nothing
grew except terebinth trees and silphium;<a name="FNanchor_496" id="FNanchor_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">496</a> notwithstanding
which, it was inhabited by many people, and
many sheep and oxen graze there; because sheep are
very fond of silphium. For if a sheep smells it even
from a distance, it runs to it and feeds upon the flower.
They also dig up the root, which is devoured by the
sheep. For this reason in Cyrene,<a name="FNanchor_497" id="FNanchor_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">497</a> some drive their
flocks as far as possible away from the places where
their silphium is growing; others even enclose the place
with a fence, so that even if the sheep should approach
it they would not be able to get within the enclosure.
For the silphium is very valuable to the Cyrenaeans.</p>

<p>Bessus, accompanied by the Persians who had taken
part with him in the seizure of Darius, and by 7,000 of
the Bactrians themselves and the Daans who dwelt on
this side the Tanais,<a name="FNanchor_498" id="FNanchor_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">498</a> was laying waste the country at the
foot of Mount Caucasus, in order to prevent Alexander
from marching any further, both by the desolation of the
land between the enemy and himself and by the lack of
provisions. But none the less did Alexander keep up
the march, though with difficulty, both on account of
the deep snow and from the want of necessaries; but
yet he persevered in his journey. When Bessus was

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>the river Oxus,<a name="FNanchor_499" id="FNanchor_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">499</a> and having burnt the boats upon which
he had crossed, he withdrew to Nautaca<a name="FNanchor_500" id="FNanchor_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">500</a> in the land of
Sogdiana. He was followed by Spitamenes and Oxyartes,
with the cavalry from Sogdiana, as well as by the Daans
from the Tanais. But the Bactrian cavalry, perceiving
that Bessus had resolved to take to flight, all dispersed
in various directions to their own abodes.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER XXIX.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Conquest of Bactria, and Pursuit of Bessus across
the Oxus.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Alexander</span> now arrived at Drapsaca, and having there
given his army a rest, he marched to Aornus and Bactra,
which are the largest cities in the land of the Bactrians.
These he took at the first assault; and left a garrison
in the citadel of Aornus, over which he placed Archelaüs
son of Androcles, one of the Companions. He appointed
Artabazus the Persian, viceroy over the rest of the
Bactrians, who were easily reduced to submission. Then
he marched towards the river Oxus, which flows from
mount Caucasus, and is the largest of all the rivers in
Asia which Alexander and his army reached, except the
Indian rivers; but the Indian rivers are the largest in
the world. The Oxus discharges its water into the great
sea which is near Hyrcania. When he attempted to
cross the river it appeared altogether impassable; for
its breadth was about six stades, and its depth was much
greater than the proportion of its breadth. The bed of
the river was sandy, and the stream so rapid, that stakes
fixed deep into the bottom were easily rooted up from
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>the earth by the mere force of the current, inasmuch as
they could not be securely fixed in the sand. Besides
this, there was a scarcity of timber in the locality, and
he thought it would take a long time and cause great
delay, if they brought from a distance the materials
needful for making a bridge over the river. Therefore
he collected the skins which the soldiers used for tent-coverings,
and ordered them to be filled with chaff as
dry as possible, and tied and stitched tightly together,
so that the water might not penetrate into them.<a name="FNanchor_501" id="FNanchor_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">501</a> When
these were filled and stitched together, they were sufficient
to convey the army across in five days. But
before he crossed the river, he selected the oldest of the
Macedonians, who were now unfit for military service,
and such of the Thessalians as had volunteered to remain
in the army, and sent them back home. He then dispatched
Stasanor, one of the Companions, into the land
of the Areians, with instructions to arrest Arsames, the
viceroy of that people, because he thought him disaffected,
and to assume the office of viceroy of Areia
himself.</p>

<p>After passing over the river Oxus, he made a forced
march to the place where he heard that Bessus was with
his forces; but at this time messengers reached him from
Spitamenes and Dataphernes, to announce that they
would arrest Bessus and hand him over to Alexander
if he would send to them a small army and a commander
for it; since even at that very time they were holding
him under guard, though they had not bound him with
fetters. When Alexander heard this, he gave his army
rest, and marched more slowly than before. But he
despatched Ptolemy, son of Lagus, at the head of three
troops of the Companion cavalry and all the horse-lancers,
and of the infantry, the brigade of Philotas, one regiment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>of 1,000 shield-bearing guards, all the Agrianians, and
half the archers, with orders to make a forced march to
Spitamenes and Dataphernes. Ptolemy went according
to his instructions, and completing ten days’ march in
four days, arrived at the camp where on the preceding
day the barbarians under Spitamenes had bivouacked.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER XXX.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Capture of Bessus.&mdash;Exploits in Sogdiana.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Here</span> Ptolemy learned that Spitamenes and Dataphernes
were not firmly resolved about the betrayal of Bessus.
He therefore left the infantry behind with orders to
follow him in regular order, and advanced with the
cavalry till he arrived at a certain village, where Bessus
was with a few soldiers; for Spitamenes and his party
had already retired from thence, being ashamed to
betray Bessus themselves. Ptolemy posted his cavalry
right round the village, which was enclosed by a wall
supplied with gates. He then issued a proclamation to
the barbarians in the village, that they would be allowed
to depart uninjured if they surrendered Bessus to him.
They accordingly admitted Ptolemy and his men into
the village. He then seized Bessus and departed; but
sent a messenger on before to ask Alexander how he
was to conduct Bessus into his presence. Alexander
ordered him to bind the prisoner naked in a wooden
collar, and thus to lead him and place him on the right-hand
side of the road along which he was about to
march with the army. Thus did Ptolemy. When
Alexander saw Bessus, he caused his chariot to stop,
and asked him, for what reason he had in the first place
arrested Darius, his own king, who was also his kinsman
and benefactor, and then led him as a prisoner in chains,
and at last killed him? Bessus said that he was not the<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
only person who had decided to do this, but that it was
the joint act of those who were at the time in attendance
upon Darius, with the view of procuring safety for themselves
from Alexander. For this Alexander ordered that
he should be scourged, and that the herald should repeat
the very same reproaches which he had himself made
to Bessus in his inquiry. After being thus disgracefully
tortured, he was sent away to Bactria to be put to death.
Such is the account given by Ptolemy in relation to
Bessus; but Aristobulus says that Spitamenes and Dataphernes
brought Bessus to Ptolemy, and having bound
him naked in a wooden collar betrayed him to Alexander.<a name="FNanchor_502" id="FNanchor_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">502</a></p>

<p>Alexander supplied his cavalry with horses from that
district, for many of his own horses had perished in the
passage of the Caucasus and in the march to and from the
Oxus. He then led his army to Maracanda,<a name="FNanchor_503" id="FNanchor_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">503</a> which is
the capital of the land of the Sogdianians. Thence he
advanced to the river Tanais. This river, which Aristobulus
says the neighbouring barbarians call by a
different name, Jaxartes, has its source, like the Oxus,
in mount Caucasus, and also discharges itself into the
Hyrcanian Sea.<a name="FNanchor_504" id="FNanchor_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">504</a> It must be a different Tanais from that
of which Herodotus the historian speaks, saying that it
is the eighth of the Scythian rivers, that it flows out
of a great lake in which it originates, and discharges
itself into a still larger lake, called the Maeotis.<a name="FNanchor_505" id="FNanchor_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">505</a> There
are some who make this Tanais the boundary of Europe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>and Asia, saying that the Palus Maeotis, issuing from the
furthest recess of the Euxine<a name="FNanchor_506" id="FNanchor_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">506</a> Sea, and this river Tanais,
which discharges itself into the Maeotis, separate Asia and
Europe,<a name="FNanchor_507" id="FNanchor_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">507</a> just in the same way as the sea near Gadeira
and the Nomad Libyans opposite Gadeira separates
Libya and Europe.<a name="FNanchor_508" id="FNanchor_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">508</a> Libya also is said by these men
to be divided from the rest of Asia by the river Nile.
In this place (viz. at the river Tanais), some of the
Macedonians, being engaged in foraging, were cut to
pieces by the barbarians. The perpetrators of this deed
escaped to a mountain, which was very rugged and
precipitous on all sides. In number they were about
30,000. Alexander took the lightest men in his army
and marched against these. Then the Macedonians
made many ineffectual assaults upon the mountain. At
first they were beaten back by the missiles of the barbarians,
and many of them were wounded, including
Alexander himself, who was shot right through the leg
with an arrow, and the fibula of his leg was broken.
Notwithstanding this, he captured the place, and some
of the barbarians were cut to pieces there by the Mace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>donians,
while many also cast themselves down from the
rocks and perished; so that out of 30,000 not more than
8,000 were preserved.<a name="FNanchor_509" id="FNanchor_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">509</a></p>

<h2>BOOK IV.</h2>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rebellion of the Sogdianians.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">A</span> few days after this, envoys reached Alexander from
the people called Abian Scythians, whom Homer commended
in his poem, calling them the justest of men.<a name="FNanchor_510" id="FNanchor_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">510</a>
This nation dwells in Asia and is independent, chiefly
by reason of its poverty and love of justice. Envoys
also came from the Scythians of Europe, who are the
largest nation dwelling in that continent.<a name="FNanchor_511" id="FNanchor_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">511</a> Alexander
sent some of the Companions with them, under the pretext
indeed that they were to conclude a friendly alliance
by the embassy; but the real object of the mission was
rather to spy into the natural features of the Scythian
land, the number of the inhabitants and their customs,
as well as the armaments which they possessed for
making military expeditions.<a name="FNanchor_512" id="FNanchor_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">512</a> He formed a plan of
founding a city near the river Tanais, which was to be
named after himself; for the site seemed to him suitable
and likely to cause the city to grow to large dimensions.
He also thought it would be built in a place which would
serve as a favourable basis of operations for an invasion
of Scythia, if such an event should ever occur; and not
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>only so, but it would also be a bulwark to secure the
land against the incursions of the barbarians dwelling
on the further side of the river. Moreover he thought
that the city would become great, both by reason of the
multitude of those who would join in colonizing it, and
on account of the celebrity of the name conferred upon
it.<a name="FNanchor_513" id="FNanchor_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">513</a> Meantime the barbarians dwelling near the river
seized upon the Macedonian soldiers who were garrisoning
their cities and killed them; after which they began
to strengthen the cities for their greater security. Most
of the Sogdianians joined them in this revolt, being
urged on to it by the men who had arrested Bessus.
These men were so energetic that they even induced
some of the Bactrians to join in the rebellion, either
because they were afraid of Alexander, or because their
seducers assigned as a reason for their revolt, that he
had sent instructions to the rulers of that land to
assemble for a conference at Zariaspa, the chief city;
which conference, they said, would be for no good
purpose.<a name="FNanchor_514" id="FNanchor_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor">514</a></p>

<hr />

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Capture of Five Cities in Two Days.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">When</span> Alexander was informed of this, he gave instructions
to the infantry, company by company, to prepare
the ladders which were assigned to each company. He
then started from the camp and advanced to the nearest
city, the name of which was Gaza; for the barbarians
of the land were said to have fled for refuge into seven
cities. He sent Craterus to the one called Cyropolis,
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>the largest of them all, into which most of the barbarians
had gathered.<a name="FNanchor_515" id="FNanchor_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">515</a> The orders of Craterus were to encamp
near the city, to dig a trench round it, to surround it
with a stockade, and to fix together the military engines
which were required for use, so that the men in this
city, having had their attention drawn to his forces,
might be unable to render aid to the other cities. As
soon as Alexander arrived at Gaza, without any delay
he gave the signal to his men to place the ladders
against the wall all round and to take it by assault at
once, as it was made merely of earth and was not at all
high. Simultaneously with the assault of the infantry,
his slingers, archers, and javelin-throwers assailed the
defenders on the wall, and missiles were hurled from
the military engines, so that the wall was quickly cleared
of its defenders by the multitude of the missiles. Then
the fixing of the ladders against the wall and the mounting
of the Macedonians were matters soon effected. They
killed all the men, according to Alexander’s injunctions;
but the women, the children, and the rest of the booty
they carried off as plunder. Thence he immediately
marched to the city situated next to that one; and this
he took in the same way and on the same day, treating
the captives in the same manner. Then he marched
against the third city, and took it on the next day at
the first assault. While he was thus occupied by these
matters with the infantry, he sent out his cavalry to the
two neighbouring cities, with orders to guard the men
within them closely, so that when they heard of the
capture of the neighbouring cities, and at the same time
of his own near approach, they should not betake themselves
to flight and render it impossible for him to pursue
them. It turned out just as he had conjectured; and
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>his despatch of the cavalry was made just at the nick
of time. For when the barbarians who occupied the
two cities still uncaptured, saw the smoke rising from
the city in front of them which was then on fire, (and
some men, escaping even from the midst of the calamity
itself, became the reporters of the capture which they
had themselves witnessed,) they began to flee in crowds
out of the cities as fast as each man could; but falling
in with the dense body of cavalry drawn up in array of
battle, most of them were cut to pieces.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Storming of Cyropolis.&mdash;Revolt of the Scythians.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Having</span> thus captured the five cities and reduced them to
slavery in two days,<a name="FNanchor_516" id="FNanchor_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">516</a> he went to Cyropolis, the largest
city in the country. It was fortified with a wall higher
than those of the others, as it had been founded by Cyrus.
The majority of the barbarians of this district, and at the
same time the most warlike of them, had fled for refuge
thither, and consequently it was not possible for the
Macedonians to capture it so easily at the first assault.
Wherefore Alexander brought his military engines up
to the wall with the determination of battering it down
in this way, and of making assaults wherever breaches
might be made in it. When be observed that the channel
of the river, which flows through the city when it is
swollen by the winter rains, was at that time nearly dry
and did not reach up to the wall, and would thus afford
his soldiers a passage by which to penetrate into the city,
he took the body-guards, the shield-bearing guards, the
archers, and Agrianians, and made his way secretly into
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>the city along the channel, at first with a few men, while
the barbarians had turned their attention towards the military
engines and those who were assailing them in that
quarter. Having from within broken open the gates
which were opposite this position, he gave an easy admittance
to the rest of his soldiers. Then the barbarians,
though they perceived that their city was already in the
hands of the enemy, nevertheless turned against Alexander
and his men and made a desperate assault upon them,
in which Alexander himself received a violent blow on
the head and neck with a stone, and Craterus was wounded
with an arrow, as were also many other officers. Notwithstanding
this, however, they drove the barbarians
out of the market-place. Meantime, those who had made
the assault upon the wall, took it, as it was now void of
defenders. In the first capture of the city about 8,000
of the enemy were killed. The rest fled for refuge into
the citadel; for 15,000 warriors in all had gathered together
in the city. Alexander encamped around these
and besieged them for one day,<a name="FNanchor_517" id="FNanchor_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">517</a> and then they surrendered
through lack of water. The seventh city he took at
the first assault. Ptolemy says that the men in it surrendered;
but Aristobulus asserts that this city was also
taken by storm, and that he slew all who were captured
therein. Ptolemy also says that he distributed the men
among the army and ordered that they should be kept
guarded in chains until he should depart from the country,
so that none of those who had effected the revolt should be
left behind. Meantime an army of the Asiatic Scythians
arrived at the bank of the river Tanais, because most of
them had heard that some of the barbarians on the opposite
side of the river had revolted from Alexander. They
intended to attack the Macedonians, if any revolutionary
movement worthy of consideration were effected. News
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>was also brought that Spitamenes was besieging the men
who had been left in the citadel at Maracanda. Against
him Alexander then despatched Andromachus, Menedemus,
and Caranus with sixty of the Companion cavalry,
800 of the mercenary cavalry under the command of
Caranus, and 1,500 mercenary infantry. Over them he
placed Pharnuches the interpreter, who, though by birth a
Lycian, was skilled in the language of the barbarians of
this country, and in other respects appeared clever in
dealing with them.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Defeat of the Scythians beyond the Tanais.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">In</span> twenty days he fortified the city which he was projecting,
and settled in it some of the Grecian mercenaries and
those of the neighbouring barbarians who volunteered to
take part in the settlement, as well as the Macedonians
from his army who were now unfit for military service.<a name="FNanchor_518" id="FNanchor_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">518</a>
He then offered sacrifice to the gods in his customary
manner and celebrated an equestrian and gymnastic contest.
When he saw that the Scythians were not retiring
from the river’s bank, but were seen to be shooting
arrows into the river, which was not wide here, and were
uttering audacious words in their barbaric tongue to
insult Alexander, to the effect that he durst not touch
Scythians, or if he did, he would learn what was the difference
between them and the Asiatic barbarians, he was
irritated by these remarks, and having resolved to cross
over against them, he began to prepare the skins for the
passage of the river.<a name="FNanchor_519" id="FNanchor_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">519</a> But when he offered sacrifice with
a view to crossing, the victims proved to be unfavourable;
and though he was vexed at this, he nevertheless con<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>trolled
himself and remained where he was. But as
the Scythians did not desist from their insults, he again
offered sacrifice with a view to crossing; and Aristander
told him that the omens still portended danger to himself.
But Alexander said that it was better for him to come
into extreme danger than that, after having subdued
almost the whole of Asia, he should be a laughing-stock
to the Scythians, as Darius, the father of Xerxes, had been
in days of yore.<a name="FNanchor_520" id="FNanchor_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">520</a> Aristander refused to explain the will
of the gods contrary to the revelations made by the deity
simply because Alexander wished to hear the contrary.
When the skins had been prepared for the passage, and
the army, fully equipped, had been posted near the river,
the military engines, at the signal pre-concerted, began to
shoot at the Scythians riding along the river’s bank.
Some of them were wounded by the missiles, and one was
struck right through the wicker-shield and breastplate
and fell from his horse. The others, being alarmed at the
discharge of missiles from so great a distance, and at the
death of their champion, retreated a little from the bank.
But Alexander, seeing them thrown into confusion by
the effect of his missiles, began to cross the river with
trumpets sounding, himself leading the way; and the rest
of the army followed him. Having first got the archers
and slingers across, he ordered them to sling and shoot
at the Scythians, to prevent them approaching the phalanx
of infantry stepping out of the water, until all his
cavalry had passed over. When they were upon the
bank in dense mass, he first of all launched against the
Scythians one regiment of the Grecian auxiliary cavalry
and four squadrons of pike-men. These the Scythians received,
and in great numbers riding round them in circles,
wounded them, as they were few in number, themselves
escaping with ease. But Alexander mixed the archers,
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>the Agrianians, and other light troops under the command
of Balacrus, with the cavalry, and then led them against
the enemy. As soon as they came to close quarters, he
ordered three regiments of the cavalry Companions and
all the horse-lancers to charge them. The rest of the
cavalry he himself led, and made a rapid attack with his
squadrons in column. Accordingly the enemy were no
longer able as before to wheel their cavalry force round
in circles, for at one and the same time the cavalry and
the light-armed infantry mixed with the horsemen pressed
upon them, and did not permit them to wheel about in
safety. Then the flight of the Scythians was already
apparent. 1,000 of them fell, including Satraces, one of
their chiefs; and 150 were captured. But as the pursuit
was keen and fatiguing on account of the excessive heat,
the entire army was seized with thirst; and Alexander
himself while riding drank of such water as was procurable
in that country. He was seized with an incessant
diarrhœa; for the water was bad; and for this reason
he could not pursue all the Scythians. Otherwise I think
all of them would have perished in the flight, if
Alexander had not fallen ill. He was carried back to the
camp, having fallen into extreme danger; and thus Aristander’s
prophecy was fulfilled.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Spitamenes Destroys a Macedonian Detachment.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Soon</span> after this, arrived envoys from the king of the
Scythians, who were sent to apologize for what had been
done, and to state that it was not the act of the Scythian
State, but of certain men who set out for plunder after
the manner of freebooters. They also assured him that
their king was willing to obey the commands laid upon
him. Alexander sent to him a courteous reply, because
it did not seem honourable for him to abstain from march<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>ing
against him if he distrusted him, and at that time
there was not an convenient opportunity to do so. The
Macedonians who were garrisoning the citadel at Maracanda,
when an assault was made upon it by Spitamenes
and his adherents, sallied forth, and killing some of the
enemy and repulsing all the rest, retreated into the citadel
without any loss. But when Spitamenes was informed
that the men despatched by Alexander to Maracanda were
now drawing near, he raised the siege of the citadel, and
retired to the capital of Sogdiana.<a name="FNanchor_521" id="FNanchor_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">521</a> Pharnuches and the
generals with him, being eager to drive him out altogether,
followed him up as he was retreating towards the
frontiers of Sogdiana, and without due consideration made
a joint attack upon the Nomad Scythians. Then Spitamenes,
having received a reinforcement of 600 Scythian
horsemen, was further emboldened by the Scythian
alliance to wait and receive the Macedonians who were
advancing upon him. Posting his men in a level place
near the Scythian desert, he was not willing either to
wait for the enemy or to attack them himself; but rode
round and discharged arrows at the phalanx of infantry.
When the forces of Pharnuches made a charge upon them,
they easily escaped, since at that time their horses were
swifter and more vigorous, while the horse of Andromachus
had been damaged by the incessant marching, as
well as by lack of fodder; and the Scythians pressed
upon them with all their might whether they halted
or retreated. Many of them then were wounded by the
arrows, and some were killed. They therefore arranged
the soldiers into the form of a square and proceeded to
the river Polytimetus,<a name="FNanchor_522" id="FNanchor_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">522</a> because there was a woody glen
near it, and it would consequently no longer be easy for
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>the barbarians to shoot arrows at them, and their infantry
would be more useful to them. But Caranus, the commander
of the cavalry, without communicating with
Andromachus, attempted to cross the river in order to
put the cavalry in a place of safety on the other side.
The infantry followed him without any word of command;
their descent into the river being made in a panic and
without any discipline down the precipitous banks. When
the barbarians perceived the error of the Macedonians,
they sprang into the ford here and there, horses and all.
Some of them seized and held tight those who had already
crossed and were departing; others being posted right in
front of those who were crossing, rolled them over into
the river; others shot arrows at them from the flanks;
while others pressed upon the men who were just entering
the water. The Macedonians being thus encompassed
with difficulty on all sides, fled for refuge into one of the
small islands in the river, where they were entirely
surrounded by the Scythians and the cavalry of Spitamenes,
and all killed with arrows, except a few of them,
whom they reduced to slavery. All of these were afterwards
killed.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Spitamenes Driven into the Desert.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">But</span> Aristobulus says the greater part of this army was
destroyed by an ambuscade, the Scythians having hidden
themselves in a park and fallen upon the Macedonians
from their place of concealment, when Pharnuches was
in the very act of retiring from the command in favour of
the Macedonians who had been sent with him, on the
ground of his not being skilled in military affairs, and of
his having been sent by Alexander rather to win the
favour of the barbarians than to take the supreme command
in battles. He also alleged that the Macedonian<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
officers present were the king’s Companions. But Andromachus,
Menedemus, and Caranus declined to accept
the chief command, partly because it did not seem right
to make any alteration on their own responsibility contrary
to Alexander’s instructions to them, and partly
because in the very crisis of danger, they were unwilling,
if they met with any defeat, not only individually to take
a share of the blame, but also collectively to exercise the
command unsuccessfully. In this confusion and disorder
the barbarians fell upon them, and cut them all off, so
that not more than forty horsemen and 300 foot preserved
their lives.<a name="FNanchor_523" id="FNanchor_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">523</a> When the report of this reached Alexander,
he was chagrined at the loss of his soldiers, and resolved to
march with all speed against Spitamenes and his barbarian
adherents. He therefore took half of the Companion
cavalry, all the shield-bearing guards, the archers, the
Agrianians, and the lightest men of the phalanx, and went
towards Maracanda, where he ascertained Spitamenes had
returned and was again besieging the men in the citadel.
Having travelled 1,500 stades in three days, at the
approach of dawn on the fourth day he came near the
city;<a name="FNanchor_524" id="FNanchor_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">524</a> but when Spitamenes was informed of Alexander’s
approach, he did not remain, but abandoned the city and
fled. Alexander pursued him closely; and coming to the
place where the battle was fought, he buried his soldiers
as well as the circumstances permitted, and then followed
the fugitives as far as the desert. Returning thence, he
laid the land waste, and slew the barbarians who had fled
for refuge into the fortified places, because they were reported
to have taken part in the attack upon the Macedonians.<a name="FNanchor_525" id="FNanchor_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">525</a>
He traversed the whole country which the
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>river Polytimetus waters in its course; but the country
beyond the place where the water of this river disappears
is desert; for though it has abundance of water, it disappears
into the sand.<a name="FNanchor_526" id="FNanchor_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor">526</a> Other large and perennial rivers
in that region disappear in a similar way:&mdash;the Epardus,
which flows through the land of the Mardians; the
Areius, after which the country of the Areians is named;
and the Etymander, which flows through the territory of
the Euergetae.<a name="FNanchor_527" id="FNanchor_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor">527</a> All of these are rivers of such a size
that none of them is smaller than the Thessalian river
Peneius, which flows through Tempē and discharges itself
into the sea. The Polytimetus is much too large to be
compared with the river Peneius.<a name="FNanchor_528" id="FNanchor_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor">528</a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Treatment of Bessus.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">When</span> he had accomplished this, he came to Zariaspa;
where he remained until the depth of winter arrived.<a name="FNanchor_529" id="FNanchor_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529" class="fnanchor">529</a> At
this time came to him Phrataphernes the viceroy of
Parthia, and Stasanor, who had been sent into the land of
the Areians to arrest Arsames.<a name="FNanchor_530" id="FNanchor_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530" class="fnanchor">530</a> Him they brought with
them in chains, as also Barzanes, whom Bessus had appointed
viceroy of the land of the Parthians, and some
others of those who at that time had joined Bessus in
revolt. At the same time arrived from the sea, Epocillus,<a name="FNanchor_531" id="FNanchor_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor">531</a>
Melamnidas and Ptolemy, the general of the Thracians,
who had convoyed down to the sea the Grecian allies and
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>the money sent with Menes.<a name="FNanchor_532" id="FNanchor_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor">532</a> At this time also arrived
Asander and Nearchus at the head of an army of Grecian
mercenaries.<a name="FNanchor_533" id="FNanchor_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533" class="fnanchor">533</a> Asclepiodorus, viceroy of Syria, and Menes
the deputy also arrived from the sea, at the head of
another army. Then Alexander gathered a conference
of those who were then at hand, and led Bessus in before
them. Having accused him of the betrayal of Darius, he
ordered his nose and ears to be cut off, and that he
should be taken to Ecbatana to be put to death there in
the council of the Medes and Persians.<a name="FNanchor_534" id="FNanchor_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor">534</a> I do not commend
this excessive punishment; on the contrary, I
consider that the mutilation of the prominent features of
the body is a barbaric<a name="FNanchor_535" id="FNanchor_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535" class="fnanchor">535</a> custom, and I agree with those
who say that Alexander was induced to indulge his
desire of emulating the Median and Persian wealth and
to treat his subjects as inferior beings according to the
custom of the foreign kings. Nor do I by any means
commend him for changing the Macedonian style of dress
which his fathers had adopted, for the Median one,<a name="FNanchor_536" id="FNanchor_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor">536</a> being
as he was a descendant of Heracles.<a name="FNanchor_537" id="FNanchor_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor">537</a> Besides, he was not
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>ashamed to exchange the head-dress which he the conqueror
had so long worn, for that of the conquered
Persians. None of these things do I commend; but I
consider Alexander’s great achievements prove, if anything
can, that supposing a man to have a vigorous bodily
constitution, to be illustrious in descent, and to be even
more successful in war than Alexander himself; even
supposing he could sail right round Libya as well as Asia,
and hold them both in subjection as Alexander indeed
designed; even if he could add the possession of Europe
to that of Asia and Libya; all these things would be no
furtherance to such a man’s happiness, unless at the same
time he possess the power of self-control, though he has
performed the great deeds which have been supposed.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Murder of Clitus.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Here</span> also I shall give an account of the tragic fate of
Clitus, son of Dropidas, and of Alexander’s mishap in
regard to it. Though it occurred a little while after
this, it will not be out place here. The Macedonians
kept a day sacred to Dionysus, and on that day Alexander
used to offer sacrifice to him every year. But they say
that on this occasion he was neglectful of Dionysus,<a name="FNanchor_538" id="FNanchor_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">538</a> and
sacrificed to the Dioscūri<a name="FNanchor_539" id="FNanchor_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor">539</a> instead; for he had resolved
to offer sacrifice to those deities for some reason or other.
When the drinking-party on this occasion had already
gone on too long (for Alexander had now made innovations
even in regard to drinking, by imitating the custom
of foreigners), and in the midst of the carouse a discussion
had arisen about the Dioscuri, how their procreation
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>had been taken away from Tyndareus and ascribed to
Zeus, some of those present, in order to flatter Alexander,
maintained that Polydeuces and Castor were in no way
worthy to compare with him who had performed so many
exploits. Such men have always corrupted the character
of kings and will never cease to ruin the interests of
those who happen to be reigning.<a name="FNanchor_540" id="FNanchor_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">540</a> In their carousal
they did not even abstain from (comparing him with)
Heracles; saying that envy prevented the living from
receiving the honours due to them from their associates.
It was well known that Clitus had long been vexed at
Alexander for the change in his style of living in imitation
of foreign kings, and at those who flattered him with
their speech. At that time also, being heated with wine,
he would not permit them either to insult the deity or,
by depreciating the deeds of the ancient heroes, to confer
upon Alexander a gratification which deserved no thanks.
He affirmed Alexander’s deeds were neither in fact so
great or marvellous as they represented in their laudation;
nor had he achieved them by himself, but for the
most part they were the deeds of the Macedonians. The
delivery of this speech annoyed Alexander; and I do not
commend it, for I think, in such a drunken bout, it would
have been sufficient if, so far as he was personally concerned,
he had kept silence, and not committed the error
of indulging in the same flattery as the others. But
when some even mentioned Philip’s actions without exercising
a just judgment, declaring that he had performed
nothing great or marvellous, they gratified Alexander;
but Clitus being then no longer able to contain himself,
began to put Philip’s achievements in the first rank, and
to depreciate Alexander and his performances.<a name="FNanchor_541" id="FNanchor_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor">541</a> Clitus
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>being now quite intoxicated, made other insolent remarks
and even greatly reviled him, because forsooth he had
saved his life, when the cavalry battle had been fought
with the Persians at the Granicus. Then indeed, arrogantly
stretching out his right hand, he said:&mdash;“This
hand, O Alexander, preserved thee on that occasion.”
Alexander could now no longer endure the drunken insolence
of Clitus; but jumped up against him in a great
rage. He was however restrained by his boon-companions.
As Clitus did not desist from his insulting remarks,
Alexander shouted out a summons for his shield-bearing
guards to attend him; but when no one obeyed
him, he said that he was reduced to the same position as
Darius, when he was led about under arrest by Bessus
and his adherents, and that he now possessed the mere
name of king. Then his companions were no longer
able to restrain him; for according to some he leaped up
and snatched a javelin from one of his confidential body-guards;
according to others, a long pike from one of his
ordinary guards, with which he struck Clitus and killed
him.<a name="FNanchor_542" id="FNanchor_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor">542</a> Aristobulus does not say whence the drunken
quarrel originated, but asserts that the fault was entirely
on the side of Clitus, who, when Alexander had got so
enraged with him as to jump up against him with the
intention of making an end of him, was led away by
Ptolemy, son of Lagus, the confidential body-guard,
through the gateway, beyond the wall and ditch of the
citadel where the quarrel occurred. He adds that Clitus
could not control himself, but went back again, and falling
in with Alexander who was calling out for Clitus, he
exclaimed:&mdash;“Alexander, here is Clitus!” Thereupon
he was struck with a long pike and killed.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Alexander’s Grief for Clitus.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">I think</span> Clitus deserving of severe censure for his insolent
behaviour to his king, while at the same time I
pity Alexander for his mishap, because on that occasion
he showed himself the slave of two vices, anger and
drunkenness, by neither of which is it seemly for a prudent
man to be enslaved. But then on the other hand
I think his subsequent behaviour worthy of praise, because
directly after he had done the deed he recognised
that it was a horrible one. Some of his biographers even
say that he propped the pike against the wall with the
intention of falling upon it himself, thinking that it was
not proper for him to live who had killed his friend when
under the influence of wine. Most historians do not
mention this, but say that he went off to bed and lay
there lamenting, calling Clitus himself by name, and his
sister Lanice, daughter of Dropidas, who had been his
nurse. He exclaimed that having reached man’s estate
he had forsooth bestowed on her a noble reward for her
care in rearing him, as she lived to see her own sons die
fighting on his behalf, and the king slaying her brother
with his own hand.<a name="FNanchor_543" id="FNanchor_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543" class="fnanchor">543</a> He did not cease calling himself
the murderer of his friends; and for three days rigidly
abstained from food and drink, and paid no attention whatever
to his personal appearance. Some of the soothsayers
revealed that the avenging wrath of Dionysus had been
the cause of his conduct, because he had omitted the
sacrifice to that deity.<a name="FNanchor_544" id="FNanchor_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor">544</a> At last with great difficulty he
was induced by his companions to touch food and to pay
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>proper attention to His person.<a name="FNanchor_545" id="FNanchor_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">545</a> He then paid to Dionysus
the sacrifice due to him, since he was not at all unwilling
to attribute the fatality rather to the avenging wrath
of the deity than to his own depravity. I think Alexander
deserves great praise for this, that he did not obstinately
persevere in evil, or still worse become a defender
and advocate of the wrong which had been done, but
confessed that he had committed a crime, being a man
and not a god. There are some who say that Anaxarchus
the Sophist<a name="FNanchor_546" id="FNanchor_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor">546</a> was summoned into Alexander’s presence to
give him consolation. Finding him lying down and
groaning, he laughed at him, and said that he did not know
that the wise men of old for this reason made Justice an
assessor of Zeus, because whatever was done by him was
justly done<a name="FNanchor_547" id="FNanchor_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547" class="fnanchor">547</a>; and therefore also that which was done by
the Great King ought to be deemed just, in the first place
by the king himself, and then by the rest of men. They
say that Alexander was then greatly consoled by these
remarks.<a name="FNanchor_548" id="FNanchor_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548" class="fnanchor">548</a> But I assert that Anaxarchus did Alexander
a great injury and one still greater than that by which he
was then oppressed, if he really thought this to be the
opinion of a wise man, that forsooth it is proper for a king
to come to hasty conclusions and act unjustly, and that
whatever is done by a king must be deemed just, no
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>matter how it is done. There is also a current report that
Alexander wished men to prostrate themselves before him
as to a god, entertaining the notion that Ammon was his
father, rather than Philip; and that he now showed his
admiration of the customs of the Persians and Medes by
changing the style of his dress, and by the alteration he
made in the general etiquette of his court. There were
not wanting those who in regard to these matters gave
way to his wishes with the design of flattering him;
among others being Anaxarchus, one of the philosophers
attending his court, and Agis, an Argive who was an
epic poet.<a name="FNanchor_549" id="FNanchor_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor">549</a></p>

<hr />

<h3>CHAPTER X.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Dispute between Callisthenes and Anaxarchus.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">But</span> it is said that Callisthenes the Olynthian, who had
studied philosophy under Aristotle, and was somewhat
brusque in his manner, did not approve of this conduct;
and so far as this is concerned I quite agree with him.
But the following remark of his, if indeed it has been
correctly recorded, I do not think at all proper, when he
declared that Alexander and his exploits were dependent
upon him and his history, and that he had not come to him
to acquire reputation from him, but to make him renowned
in the eyes of men;<a name="FNanchor_550" id="FNanchor_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor">550</a> consequently that Alexander’s participation
in divinity did not depend on the false assertion
of Olympias in regard to the author of his birth, but on
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>what he might report to mankind in his history of the
king. There are some writers also who have said that on
one occasion Philotas forsooth asked him, what man he
thought to be held in especial honour by the people of
Athens; and that he replied:&mdash;“Harmodius and Aristogeiton;
because they slew one of the two despots, and
put an end to the despotism.”<a name="FNanchor_551" id="FNanchor_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551" class="fnanchor">551</a> Philotas again asked:&mdash;“If
it happened now that a man should kill a despot, to
which of the Grecian States would you wish him to flee
for preservation?” Callisthenes again replied:&mdash;“If
not among others, at any rate among the Athenians an
exile would find preservation; for they waged war on behalf
of the sons of Heracles against Eurystheus, who at
that time was ruling as a despot over Greece.”<a name="FNanchor_552" id="FNanchor_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552" class="fnanchor">552</a> How he
resisted Alexander in regard to the ceremony of prostration,
the following is the most received account.<a name="FNanchor_553" id="FNanchor_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553" class="fnanchor">553</a> An
arrangement was made between Alexander and the
Sophists in conjunction with the most illustrious of the
Persians and Medes who were in attendance upon him,
that this topic should be mentioned at a wine-party.
Anaxarchus commenced the discussion<a name="FNanchor_554" id="FNanchor_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554" class="fnanchor">554</a> by saying that
he considered Alexander much more worthy of being
deemed a god than either Dionysus or Heracles, not only
on account of the very numerous and mighty exploits
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>which he had performed, but also because Dionysus was
only a Theban, in no way related to Macedonians; and
Heracles was an Argive, not at all related to them,
except that Alexander deduced his descent from him.
He added that the Macedonians might with greater justice
gratify their king with divine honours, for there was no
doubt about this, that when he departed from men they
would honour him as a god. How much more just then
would it be to worship him while alive, than after his
death, when it would be no advantage to him to be
honoured.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER XI.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Callisthenes Opposes the Proposal to Honour
Alexander by Prostration.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">When</span> Anaxarchus had uttered these remarks and others
of a similar kind, those who were privy to the plan applauded
his speech, and wished at once to begin the ceremony
of prostration. Most of the Macedonians, however,
were vexed<a name="FNanchor_555" id="FNanchor_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555" class="fnanchor">555</a> at the speech and kept silence. But Callisthenes
interposed and said:&mdash;“O Anaxarchus, I openly
declare that there is no honour which Alexander is unworthy
to receive, provided that it is consistent with his
being human; but men have made distinctions between
those honours which are due to men, and those due to
gods, in many different ways, as for instance by the
building of temples and by the erection of statues.
Moreover for the gods sacred enclosures are selected, to
them sacrifice is offered, and to them libations are made.
Hymns also are composed in honour of the gods, and
eulogies for men. But the greatest distinction is made
by the custom of prostration. For it is the practice that
men should be kissed by those who salute them<a name="FNanchor_556" id="FNanchor_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556" class="fnanchor">556</a>; but
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>because the deity is located somewhere above, it is not
lawful even to touch him, and this is the reason no doubt
why he is honoured by prostration. Bands of choral
dancers are also appointed for the gods, and paeans are
sung in their honour. And this is not at all wonderful,
seeing that certain honours are specially assigned to some
of the gods and certain others to other gods, and, by Zeus,
quite different ones again are assigned to heroes, which
are very distinct from those paid to the deities.<a name="FNanchor_557" id="FNanchor_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557" class="fnanchor">557</a> It is not
therefore reasonable to confound all these distinctions
without discrimination, exalting men to a rank above
their condition by extravagant accumulation of honours,
and debasing the gods, as far as lies in human power, to
an unseemly level, by paying them honours only equal
to those paid to men.” He said that Alexander would not
endure the affront, if some private individual were to be
thrust into his royal honours by an unjust vote, either by
show of hand or by ballot. Much more justly then would
the gods be indignant at those mortals who usurp divine
honours or suffer themselves to be thrust into them
by others. “Alexander not only seems to be, but is in
reality beyond any competition the bravest of brave men,
of kings the most kingly, and of generals the most
worthy to command an army. O Anaxarchus, it was
thy duty, rather than any other man’s, to become the
special advocate of these arguments now adduced by me,
and the opponent of those contrary to them, seeing that
thou associatest with him for the purpose of imparting
philosophy and instruction. Therefore it was unseemly
to begin this discussion, when thou oughtest to have remembered
that thou art not associating with and giving
advice to Cambyses or Xerxes, but to the son of Philip,
who derives his origin from Heracles and Aeacus,<a name="FNanchor_558" id="FNanchor_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558" class="fnanchor">558</a> whose
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>ancestors came into Macedonia from Argos, and have
continued to rule the Macedonians, not by force, but by
law. Not even to Heracles himself while still alive were
divine honours paid by the Greeks; and even after his
death they were withheld until a decree had been published
by the oracle of the god at Delphi that men should
honour Heracles as a god. But if, because the discussion
is held<a name="FNanchor_559" id="FNanchor_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559" class="fnanchor">559</a> in the land of foreigners, we ought to adopt the
sentiments of foreigners, I demand, O Alexander, that
thou shouldst bethink thyself of Greece, for whose sake
the whole of this expedition was undertaken by thee,
that thou mightest join Asia to Greece. Therefore make
up thy mind whether thou wilt return thither and compel
the Greeks, who are men most devoted to freedom, to pay
thee the honour of prostration, or whether thou wilt keep
aloof from Greece, and inflict this honour on the Macedonians
alone, or thirdly whether thou wilt thyself make
a difference in every respect as to the honours to be paid
thee, so as to be honoured by the Greeks and Macedonians
as a human being and after the manner of the
Greeks, and by foreigners alone after the foreign fashion
of prostration. But if it is said that Cyrus, son of
Cambyses, was the first man to whom the honour of
prostration was paid, and that afterwards this degrading
ceremony continued in vogue among the Persians and
Medes, we ought to bear in mind that the Scythians,
men poor but independent, chastised that Cyrus;<a name="FNanchor_560" id="FNanchor_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560" class="fnanchor">560</a> that
other Scythians again chastised Darius, as the Athenians
and Lacedaemonians did Xerxes, as Clearchus and Xenophon
with their 10,000 followers did Artaxerxes; and
finally, that Alexander, though not honoured with prostration,
has conquered this Darius.”</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Callisthenes Refuses to Prostrate Himself.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">By</span> making these and other remarks of a similar kind,
Callisthenes greatly annoyed Alexander, but spoke the
exact sentiments of the Macedonians. When the king
perceived this, he sent to prevent the Macedonians from
making any farther mention of the ceremony of prostration.
But after the discussion silence ensued; and
then the most honourable of the Persians arose in due
order and prostrated their bodies before him. But when
one of the Persians seemed to have performed the ceremony
in an awkward way, Leonnatus, one of the Companions,
laughed at his posture as mean. Alexander at the
time was angry with him for this, but was afterwards
reconciled to him.<a name="FNanchor_561" id="FNanchor_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561" class="fnanchor">561</a> The following account has also been
given:&mdash;Alexander drank from a golden goblet the health
of the circle of guests, and handed it first to those with
whom he had concerted the ceremony of prostration.
The first who drank from the goblet rose up and performed
the act of prostration, and received a kiss from
him. This ceremony proceeded from one to another in
due order. But when the pledging of health came to the
turn of Callisthenes, he rose up and drank from the
goblet, and drew near, wishing to kiss the king without
performing the act of prostration. Alexander happened
then to be conversing with Hephaestion, and consequently
did not observe whether Callisthenes performed
the ceremony properly or not. But when Callisthenes
was approaching to kiss him, Demetrius, son of Pythonax,
one of the Companions, said that he was doing so without
having prostrated himself. So the king would not permit
him to kiss him; whereupon the philosopher said:&mdash;“I
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>am going away only with the loss of a kiss.” I by no
means approve any of these proceedings, which manifested
both the insolence of Alexander on the present occasion
and the churlish nature of Callisthenes. But I think
that, so far as regards himself, it would have been quite
sufficient if he had given his opinion discreetly, magnifying
as much as possible the exploits of the king, with
whom no one thought it a dishonour to associate. Therefore
I consider that not without reason Callisthenes became
odious to Alexander on account of the unseasonable
freedom of speech in which he indulged,<a name="FNanchor_562" id="FNanchor_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor">562</a> as well as from
the egregious fatuity of his conduct. I surmise that this
was the reason why such easy credit was given to those
who accused him of participating in the conspiracy formed
against Alexander by his pages, and to those also who
affirmed that they had been incited to engage in the conspiracy
by him alone. The facts of this conspiracy were
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER XIII.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Conspiracy of the Pages.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">It</span> was a custom introduced by Philip, that the sons of
those Macedonians who had enjoyed high office, should,
as soon as they reached the age of puberty, be selected
to attend the king’s court. These youths were entrusted
with the general attendance on the king’s person and
the protection of his body while he was asleep. Whenever
the king rode out, some of them received the horses
from the grooms, and brought them to him, and others
assisted him to mount in the Persian fashion. They were
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>also companions of the king in the emulation of the
chase.<a name="FNanchor_563" id="FNanchor_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563" class="fnanchor">563</a> Among these youths was Hermolaüs, son of
Sopolis, who seemed to be applying his mind to the study
of philosophy, and to be cultivating the society of
Callisthenes for this purpose. There is current a tale
about this youth to the effect that in the chase, a boar
rushed at Alexander, and that Hermolaüs anticipated
him by casting a javelin at the beast, by which it was
smitten and killed. But Alexander, having lost the
opportunity of distinguishing himself by being too late
in the assault, was indignant with Hermolaüs, and in his
wrath ordered him to receive a scourging in sight of the
other pages; and also deprived him of his horse. This
Hermolaüs, being chagrined at the disgrace he had incurred,
told Sostratus, son of Amyntas, who was his
equal in age and intimate confidential friend, that life
would be insupportable to him unless he could take
vengeance upon Alexander for the affront. He easily
persuaded Sostratus to join in the enterprise, since he
was fondly attached to him. They gained over to their
plans Antipater, son of Asclepiodorus, viceroy of Syria,
Epimenes son of Arseas, Anticles son of Theocritus, and
Philotas son of Carsis the Thracian. They therefore
agreed to kill the king by attacking him in his sleep, on
the night when the nocturnal watch came round to
Antipater’s turn. Some say that Alexander accidentally
happened to be drinking until daybreak; but Aristobulus
has given the following account: A Syrian woman,
who was under the inspiration of the deity, used to follow
Alexander about. At first she was a subject of mirth
to Alexander and his courtiers; but when all that she
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>said in her inspiration was seen to be true, he no longer
treated her with neglect, but she was allowed to have free
access to him both by night and day, and she often took
her stand near him even when he was asleep. And indeed
on that occasion, when he was withdrawing from
the drinking-party she met him, being under the inspiration
of the deity at the time, and besought him to return
and drink all night. Alexander, thinking that there was
something divine in the warning, returned and went on
drinking; and thus the enterprise of the pages fell
through.<a name="FNanchor_564" id="FNanchor_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564" class="fnanchor">564</a> The next day, Epimenes son of Arseas, one
of those who took part in the conspiracy, spoke of the
undertaking to Charicles son of Menander, who had become
his confidential friend; and Charicles told it to
Eurylochus, brother of Epimenes. Eurylochus went to
Alexander’s tent and related the whole affair to Ptolemy
son of Lagus, one of the confidential body-guards. He
told Alexander, who ordered those whose names had been
mentioned by Eurylochus to be arrested. These, being
put on the rack, confessed their own conspiracy, and
mentioned the names of certain others.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER XIV.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Execution of Callisthenes and Hermolaüs.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Aristobulus</span> says that the youths asserted it was Callisthenes
who instigated them to make the daring attempt;
and Ptolemy says the same.<a name="FNanchor_565" id="FNanchor_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor">565</a> Most writers, however, do
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>not agree with this, but represent that Alexander readily
believed the worst about Callisthenes, from the hatred
which he already felt towards him, and because Hermolaüs
was known to be exceedingly intimate with him.
Some authors have also recorded the following particulars:&mdash;that
Hermolaüs was brought before the Macedonians,
to whom he confessed that he had conspired
against the king’s life, because it was no longer possible
for a free man to bear his insolent tyranny. He then
recounted all his acts of despotism, the illegal execution
of Philotas, the still more illegal one of his father
Parmenio and of the others who were put to death at
that time, the murder of Clitus in a fit of drunkenness,
his assumption of the Median garb, the introduction of
the ceremony of prostration, which had been planned and
not yet relinquished, and the drinking-bouts and lethargic
sleep arising from them, to which he was addicting himself.<a name="FNanchor_566" id="FNanchor_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566" class="fnanchor">566</a>
He said that, being no longer able to bear these things,
he wished to free both himself and the other Macedonians.
These same authors say that Hermolaüs himself
and those who had been arrested with him were stoned
to death by those who were present. Aristobulus says
that Callisthenes was carried about with the army bound
with fetters, and afterwards died a natural death; but
Ptolemy, son of Lagus, says that he was stretched upon
the rack and then hanged.<a name="FNanchor_567" id="FNanchor_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567" class="fnanchor">567</a> Thus not even did these
authors, whose narratives are very trustworthy, and who
at the time were in intimate association with Alexander,
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>give accounts consistent with each other of events so
well known, and the circumstances of which could not
have escaped their notice. Other writers have given
many various details of these same proceedings which
are inconsistent with each other; but I think I have
written quite sufficient on this subject. Though these
events took place shortly after the death of Clitus,<a name="FNanchor_568" id="FNanchor_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor">568</a> I
have described them among those which happened to
Alexander in reference to that General, because, for the
purposes of narrative, I consider them very intimately
connected with each other.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER XV.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Alliance with the Scythians and Chorasmians.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Another</span> embassy from the European Scythians came to
Alexander with the envoys whom he had despatched to
those people; for the king who was reigning over them
at the time when he sent these envoys, happened to die,
and his brother was reigning in his stead. The object
of the embassy was to state that the Scythians were
willing to do whatsoever Alexander commanded. They
were also bringing to him from their king the gifts
which among them are deemed most valuable. They
said their monarch was willing to give his daughter to
Alexander in marriage, in order to confirm the friendship
and alliance with him; but if Alexander himself deigned
not to marry the princess of the Scythians, then he was
willing at any rate to give the daughters of the viceroys
of the Scythian territory and of the other mighty men
throughout the country of Scythia to the most faithful of
Alexander’s officers. He also sent word that he would
come in person if bidden, in order to hear from Alexander’s
own mouth what his orders were. At this time
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>also came Pharasmanes, king of the Chorasmians,<a name="FNanchor_569" id="FNanchor_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor">569</a> to
Alexander with 1,500 horsemen, who affirmed that he
dwelt on the confines of the nations of the Colchians
and the women called Amazons,<a name="FNanchor_570" id="FNanchor_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor">570</a> and promised, if Alexander
was willing to march against these nations in order
to subjugate the races in this district whose territories
extended to the Euxine Sea, to act as his guide through
the mountains and to supply his army with provisions.
Alexander then gave a courteous reply to the men who
had come from the Scythians, and one that was adapted
to the exigencies of that particular time; but said that
he had no need of a Scythian wedding. He also commended
Pharasmanes and concluded a friendship and
alliance with him, saying that at present it was not convenient
for him to march towards the Euxine Sea. After
introducing Pharasmanes as a friend to Artabazus the
Persian, to whom he had intrusted the government of
the Bactrians,<a name="FNanchor_571" id="FNanchor_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571" class="fnanchor">571</a> and to all the other viceroys who were
his neighbours, he sent him back to his own abode. He
said that his mind at that time was engrossed by the
desire of conquering the Indians; for when he had
subdued them, he should possess the whole of Asia. He
added that when Asia was in his power he would return
to Greece, and thence make an expedition with all his
naval and military forces to the eastern extremity of the
Euxine Sea through the Hellespont and Propontis.<a name="FNanchor_572" id="FNanchor_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572" class="fnanchor">572</a> He
desired Pharasmanes to reserve the fulfilment of his
present promises until then.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span></p>

<p>Alexander then returned to the river Oxus, with the
intention of advancing into Sogdiana, because news was
brought that many of the Sogdianians had fled for refuge
into their strongholds and refused to submit to the
viceroy whom he had placed over them. While he was
encamping near the river Oxus, a spring of water and
near it another of oil rose from the ground not far from
Alexander’s own tent. When this prodigy was announced
to Ptolemy, son of Lagus, the confidential body-guard,
he told Alexander, who offered the sacrifices which the
prophets directed on account of the phenomenon. Aristander
affirmed that the spring of oil was the sign of
labours; but it also signified that after the labours there
would be victory.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER XVI.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Subjugation of Sogdiana.&mdash;Revolt of Spitamenes.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">He</span> therefore crossed the river with a part of his army
and entered Sogdiana, leaving Polysperchon, Attalus,
Gorgias, and Meleager there among the Bactrians, with
instructions to guard the land, to prevent the barbarians
of that region from making any revolutionary change,
and to reduce those who had already rebelled. He
divided the army which he had with him into five parts;
the first of which he put under the command of Hephaestion,
the second under that of Ptolemy, son of Lagus,
the confidential body-guard; over the third he put
Perdiccas; Coenus and Artabazus commanded the fourth
brigade for him, while be himself took the fifth division
and penetrated into the land towards Maracanda.<a name="FNanchor_573" id="FNanchor_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573" class="fnanchor">573</a> The
others also advanced as each found it practicable, reducing
by force some of those who had fled for refuge into the
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>strongholds, and capturing others who surrendered to
them on terms of capitulation. When all his forces
reached Maracanda, after traversing the greater part of
the land of the Sogdianians, he sent Hephaestion away
to plant colonies in the cities of Sogdiana. He also sent
Coenus and Artabazus into Scythia, because he was informed
that Spitamenes had fled for refuge thither; but
he himself with the rest of his army traversed Sogdiana
and easily reduced all the places still held by the rebels.</p>

<p>While Alexander was thus engaged, Spitamenes, accompanied
by some of the Sogdianian exiles, fled into
the land of the Scythians called Massagetians,<a name="FNanchor_574" id="FNanchor_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574" class="fnanchor">574</a> and
having collected 600 horsemen from this nation, he came
to one of the forts in Bactriana. Palling upon the commander
of this fort, who was not expecting any hostile
demonstration, and upon those who were keeping guard
with him, he destroyed the soldiers, and capturing the
commander, kept him in custody. Being emboldened by
the capture of this fort, a few days after he approached
Zariaspa; but resolving not to attack the city, he
marched away after collecting a great quantity of booty.
But at Zariaspa a few of the Companion cavalry had
been left behind on the score of illness, and with them
Peithon, son of Sosicles,<a name="FNanchor_575" id="FNanchor_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575" class="fnanchor">575</a> who had been placed over the
royal household of attendants at Zariaspa, and Aristonicus
the harper. These men, hearing of the incursion of the
Scythians, and having now recovered from their illness,
took their arms and mounted their horses. Then collecting
eighty mercenary Grecian horsemen, who had
been left behind to guard Zariaspa, and some of the royal
pages, they sallied forth against the Massagetians. Fall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>ing
upon the Scythians, who had no suspicion of such
an event, they deprived them of all the booty at the first
onset, and killed many of those who were driving it off.
But as no one was in command, they returned without
any regard to order: and being drawn into an ambush
by Spitamenes and other Scythians, they lost seven of
the Companions and sixty of the mercenary cavalry.
Aristonicus the harper was also slain there, having proved
himself a brave man, beyond what might have been expected
of a harper. Peithon, being wounded, was taken
prisoner by the Scythians.<a name="FNanchor_576" id="FNanchor_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576" class="fnanchor">576</a></p>

<hr />

<h3>CHAPTER XVII.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Defeat and Death of Spitamenes.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">When</span> this news was brought to Craterus, he made a
forced march against the Massagetians, who, when they
heard that he was marching against them, fled as fast
as they could towards the desert. Following them up
closely, he overtook those very men and more than 1,000
other Massagetian horsemen, not far from the desert. A
fierce battle ensued, in which the Macedonians were
victorious. Of the Scythians, 150 horsemen were slain;
but the rest of them easily escaped into the desert, for
it was impossible for the Macedonians to pursue them
any further. At this time, Alexander relieved Artabazus
of the viceroyalty of the Bactrians, at his own request,
on the ground of his advanced age; and Amyntas, son
of Nicolaüs, was appointed viceroy in his stead.<a name="FNanchor_577" id="FNanchor_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577" class="fnanchor">577</a> Coenus
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>was left with his own brigade and that of Meleager,
400 of the Companion cavalry, and all the horse-archers,
besides the Bactrians, Sogdianians, and others
who were under the command of Amyntas. They were
all under strict injunctions to obey Coenus and to
winter there in Sogdiana, in order to protect the
country and to arrest Spitamenes, if anyhow they might
be able to draw him into an ambush, as he was wandering
about during the winter. But when Spitamenes
saw that every place was occupied by the Macedonians
for a garrison, and that there would soon be no way of
flight left open to him, he turned round against Coenus
and the army with him, thinking that he would be
better able to fight in this way. Coming to Bagae, a
fortified place in Sogdiana, situated on the confines of
the countries of the Sogdianians and the Massagetian
Scythians, he easily persuaded 3,000 Scythian horsemen
to join him in an invasion of Sogdiana. It is an easy
matter to induce these Scythians to engage in one war
after another, because they are pinched by poverty, and
at the same time have no cities or settled abodes, to give
them cause for anxiety about what is most dear to them.
When Coenus ascertained that Spitamenes was advancing
with his cavalry, he went to meet him with his army. A
sharp contest ensued, in which the Macedonians were
victorious, so that of the barbarian cavalry over 800 fell
in the battle, while Coenus lost 25 horsemen and twelve
foot-soldiers. The consequence was, that the Sogdianians
who were still left with Spitamenes, as well as most of
the Bactrians, deserted him in the flight, and came to
Coenus to surrender. The Massagetian Scythians having
met with ill-success in the battle, plundered the baggage
of the Bactrians and Sogdianians who were serving in
the same army as themselves, and then fled into the
desert in company with Spitamenes. But when they were
informed that Alexander was already on the start to<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
march into the desert, they cut off the head of Spitamenes
and sent it to him, with the hope by this deed of
diverting him from pursuing them.<a name="FNanchor_578" id="FNanchor_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578" class="fnanchor">578</a></p>

<hr />

<h3>CHAPTER XVIII.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Oxyartes Besieged in the Sogdian Rock.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Meantime</span> Coenus returned to Alexander at Nautaca, as
also did Craterus, Phrataphernes the viceroy of the
Parthians, and Stasanor the viceroy of the Areians, after
executing all the orders which Alexander had given
them. The king then caused his army to rest around
Nautaca, because it was now mid-winter; but he despatched
Phrataphernes into the land of the Mardians
and Tapurians to fetch Autophradates the viceroy, because,
though he had often been sent for, he did not obey
the summons. He also sent Stasanor into the land of
the Drangians, and Atropates into Media,<a name="FNanchor_579" id="FNanchor_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579" class="fnanchor">579</a> with the appointment
of viceroy over the Medes, because Oxodates
seemed disaffected to him. Stamenes also he despatched
to Babylon, because news came to him that Mazaeus the
Babylonian governor was dead. Sopolis, Epocillus, and
Menidas he sent away to Macedonia, to bring him the
army up from that country. At the first appearance of
spring,<a name="FNanchor_580" id="FNanchor_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580" class="fnanchor">580</a> he advanced towards the rock in Sogdiana, to
which he was informed many of the Sogdianians had
fled for refuge; among whom were said to be the
wife and daughters of Oxyartes the Bactrian, who had
deposited them for safety in that place, as if forsooth it
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>were impregnable. For he also had revolted from Alexander.
If this rock was captured, it seemed that nothing
would be left to those of the Sogdianians who wished to
throw off their allegiance. When Alexander approached
it, he found it precipitous on all sides against assault,
and that the barbarians had collected provisions for a
long siege. The great quantity of snow which had
fallen helped to make the approach more difficult to the
Macedonians, while at the same time it kept the barbarians
supplied with plenty of water. But notwithstanding
all this, he resolved to assault the place; for a certain
overweening and insolent boast uttered by the barbarians
had thrown him into a wrathful state of ambitious pertinacity.
For when they were invited to come to terms
of capitulation, and it was held out to them as an inducement,
that if they surrendered the place, they would
be allowed to withdraw in safety to their own abodes,
they burst out laughing, and in their barbaric tongue
bade Alexander seek winged soldiers, to capture the
mountain for him, since they had no apprehension of
danger from other men.<a name="FNanchor_581" id="FNanchor_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor">581</a> He then issued a proclamation
that the first man who mounted should have a reward of
twelve talents,<a name="FNanchor_582" id="FNanchor_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582" class="fnanchor">582</a> the man who came next to him the second
prize, and the third so on in proportion, so that the last
reward should be three hundred darics<a name="FNanchor_583" id="FNanchor_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor">583</a> to the last prize-taker
who reached the top. This proclamation excited
the valour of the Macedonians still more, though they
were even before very eager to commence the assault.</p>

<hr />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span></p><h3>CHAPTER XIX.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Alexander Captures the Rock and Marries Roxana.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">All</span> the men who had gained practice in scaling rocks
in sieges, banded themselves together to the number of
three hundred, and provided themselves with the small
iron pegs with which their tents had been fastened to
the ground, with the intention of fixing them into the
snow, where it might be seen to be frozen hard, or into
the ground, if it should anywhere exhibit itself free from
snow. Tying strong ropes made of flax to these pegs,
they advanced in the night towards the most precipitous
part of the rock, which was also most unguarded; and
fixing some of these pegs into the earth, where it made
itself visible, and others into the snow where it seemed
least likely to break up, they hoisted themselves up the
rock, some in one place and some in another. Thirty of
them perished in the ascent; and as they fell into various
parts of the snows, not even could their bodies be found
for burial. The rest, however, reached the top of the
mountain at the approach of dawn; and taking possession
of it, they waved linen flags towards the camp
of the Macedonians,<a name="FNanchor_584" id="FNanchor_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584" class="fnanchor">584</a> as Alexander had directed them
to do. He now sent a herald with instructions to shout
to the sentries of the barbarians to make no further
delay, but surrender at once; since “the winged men”
had been found, and the summits of the mountain were
in their possession. At the same time the herald pointed
at the soldiers upon the crest of the mountain. The
barbarians, being alarmed by the unexpectedness of the
sight, and suspecting that the men who were occupying
the peaks were more numerous than they really were,
and that they were completely armed, surrendered, so
frightened did they become at the sight of those few
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>Macedonians. The wives and children of many important
men were there captured, including those of Oxyartes.
This chief had a daughter, a maiden of marriageable
age, named Roxana,<a name="FNanchor_585" id="FNanchor_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor">585</a> who was asserted by the men who
served in Alexander’s army to have been the most
beautiful of all Asiatic women, with the single exception
of the wife of Darius.<a name="FNanchor_586" id="FNanchor_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586" class="fnanchor">586</a> They also say that no sooner did
Alexander see her than he fell in love with her; but
though he was in love with her, he refused to offer
violence to her as a captive, and did not think it
derogatory to his dignity to marry her. This conduct of
Alexander I think worthy rather of praise than blame.
Moreover, in regard to the wife of Darius, who was said
to be the most beautiful woman in Asia, he either did
not entertain a passion for her, or else he exercised
control over himself,<a name="FNanchor_587" id="FNanchor_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587" class="fnanchor">587</a> though he was young, and in the
very meridian of success, when men usually act with
insolence and violence. On the contrary, he acted with
modesty and spared her honour, exercising a great
amount of chastity, and at the same time exhibiting a
very proper desire to obtain a good reputation.<a name="FNanchor_588" id="FNanchor_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588" class="fnanchor">588</a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XX.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Magnanimous Treatment of the Family of Darius.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">In</span> relation to this subject there is a story current, that
soon after the battle which was fought at Issus between
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>Darius and Alexander, the eunuch who was guardian of
Darius’s wife escaped and came to him. When Darius
saw this man, his first inquiry was, whether his children,
wife, and mother were alive? Ascertaining that
they were not only alive, but were called queens, and
enjoyed the same personal service and attention which
they had been accustomed to have with Darius, he thereupon
made a second inquiry, whether his wife was still
chaste? When he ascertained that she remained so, he
asked again whether Alexander had not offered any
violence to her to gratify his lust? The eunuch took an
oath and said: “O king, thy wife is just as thou didst
leave her; and Alexander is the best and most chaste of
men.” Upon this Darius stretched his hands towards
heaven and prayed as follows:&mdash;“O King Zeus,<a name="FNanchor_589" id="FNanchor_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589" class="fnanchor">589</a> to
whom power has been assigned to regulate the affairs of
kings among men, do thou now protect for me especially
the empire of the Persians and Medes, as indeed thou
didst give it to me. But if I am no longer king of Asia
according to thy behest, at any rate do thou hand over
my power to no other man but Alexander.” Thus not
even to enemies, I ween, are chaste actions a matter of
unconcern. Oxyartes, hearing that his children were in
the power of Alexander, and that he was treating his
daughter Roxana with respect, took courage and came to
him. He was held in honour at the king’s court, as was
natural after such a piece of good fortune.<a name="FNanchor_590" id="FNanchor_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_590" class="fnanchor">590</a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXI.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Capture of the Rock of Chorienes.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">When</span> Alexander had finished his operations among the
Sogdianians, and was now in possession of the rock,
he advanced into the land of the Paraetacians, because
many of the barbarians were said to be holding another
rock, a strongly fortified place in that country. This
was called the rock of Chorienes; and to it Chorienes
himself and many other chiefs had fled for refuge. The
height of this rock was about twenty stades, and the
circuit about sixty. It was precipitous on all sides, and
there was only one ascent to it, which was narrow and
not easy to mount, since it had been constructed in spite
of the nature of the place. It was therefore difficult
to ascend even by men in single file and when no one
barred the way. A deep ravine also enclosed<a name="FNanchor_591" id="FNanchor_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591" class="fnanchor">591</a> the rock
all round, so that whoever intended to lead an army up
to it, must long before make a causeway of earth over
this ravine in order that he might start from level ground,
when he led his troops to the assault. Notwithstanding
all this, Alexander undertook the enterprise. To so great
a pitch of audacity had he advanced through his career
of success, that he thought every place ought to be
accessible to him,<a name="FNanchor_592" id="FNanchor_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592" class="fnanchor">592</a> and to be captured by him. He cut
down the pines, which were very abundant and lofty all
round the mountain, and made ladders of them, so that
by means of them the soldiers might be able to descend
into the ravine<a name="FNanchor_593" id="FNanchor_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593" class="fnanchor">593</a>; for otherwise it was impossible for them
to do so. During the daytime he himself superintended
the work, keeping half of his army engaged in it; and
during the night his confidential body-guards, Perdiccas,
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>Leonnatus, and Ptolemy, son of Lagus, in turn with the
other half of the army, divided into three parts, performed
the duty which had been assigned to each for
the night. But they could complete no more than
twenty cubits in a day, and not quite so much in a
night, though the whole army engaged in the labour; so
difficult was the place to approach and so hard was the
work in it. Descending into the ravine, they fastened
pegs into the sharpest and narrowest part of it, distant
from each other as far as was consistent with
strength to support the weight of what was placed upon
them. Upon these they placed hurdles made of willow
and osiers, very much in the form of a bridge. Binding
these together, they loaded earth above them, so that
there might be an approach to the rock for the army on
level ground. At first the barbarians derided, as if the
attempt was altogether abortive; but when the arrows
began to reach the rock, and they were unable to drive
back the Macedonians, though they themselves were
on a higher level, because the former had constructed
screens to ward off the missiles, that they might carry
on their labour under them without receiving injury,
Chorienes grew alarmed at what was being done, and
sent a herald to Alexander, beseeching him to send
Oxyartes up to him. Alexander accordingly sent
Oxyartes, who on his arrival persuaded Chorienes to
entrust himself and the place to Alexander; for he told
him that there was nothing which Alexander and his
army could not take by storm; and as he himself had
entered into an alliance of fidelity and friendship with
him, he commended the king’s honour and justice in high
terms, adducing other examples, and above all his own
case for the confirmation of his arguments. By these
representations Chorienes was persuaded and came himself
to Alexander, accompanied by some of his relations
and companions. When he arrived, the king gave him<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
a courteous answer to his inquiries, and retained him
after pledging his fidelity and friendship. But he bade
him send to the rock some of those who came down with
him to order his men to surrender the place; and it was
surrendered by those who had fled to it for refuge.
Alexander therefore took 500 of his shield-bearing guards
and went up to get a view of the rock; and was so far
from inflicting any harsh treatment upon Chorienes that
he entrusted that very place to him again, and made him
governor of all that he had ruled before. It happened
that the army suffered much hardship from the severity
of the winter, a great quantity of snow having fallen
during the siege; while at the same time the men were
reduced to great straits from lack of provisions. But
Chorienes said he would give the army food for two
months; and he gave the men in every tent corn, wine,
and salted meat out of the stores in the rock. When he
had given them this, he said he had not exhausted even
the tenth part of what had been laid up for the siege.
Hence Alexander held him in still greater honour, inasmuch
as he had surrendered the rock, not so much from
compulsion as from his own inclination.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Alexander Reaches the River Cabul, and Receives
the Homage of Taxiles.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">After</span> performing this exploit, Alexander himself went
to Bactra; but sent Craterus with 600 of the cavalry
Companions and his own brigade of infantry as well those
of Polysperchon, Attalus, and Alcetas, against Catanes and
Austanes, who were the only rebels still remaining in the
land of the Paraetacenians.<a name="FNanchor_594" id="FNanchor_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594" class="fnanchor">594</a> A sharp battle was fought
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>with them, in which Craterus was victorious; Catanes
being killed there while fighting, and Austanes being
captured and brought to Alexander. Of the barbarians
with them 120 horsemen and about 1,500 foot soldiers were
killed. When Craterus had done this, he also went to
Bactra, where the tragedy in reference to Callisthenes and
the pages befell Alexander. As the spring was now over,
he took the army and advanced from Bactra towards
India,<a name="FNanchor_595" id="FNanchor_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595" class="fnanchor">595</a> leaving Amyntas in the land of the Bactrians with
3,500 horse, and 10,000 foot. He crossed the Caucasus<a name="FNanchor_596" id="FNanchor_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596" class="fnanchor">596</a>
in ten days and arrived at the city of Alexandria, which
had been founded in the land of the Parapamisadae when
he made his first expedition to Bactra. He dismissed
from office the governor whom he had then placed over
the city, because be thought he was not ruling well. He
also settled in Alexandria others from the neighbouring
tribes and the soldiers who were now unfit for service in
addition to the first settlers, and commanded Nicanor,
one of the Companions, to regulate the affairs of the city
itself. Moreover he appointed Tyriaspes viceroy of the
land of the Parapamisadae and of the rest of the country
as far as the river Cophen.<a name="FNanchor_597" id="FNanchor_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597" class="fnanchor">597</a> Arriving at the city of
Nicaea, he offered sacrifice to Athena and then advanced
towards the Cophen, sending a herald forward to Taxiles<a name="FNanchor_598" id="FNanchor_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598" class="fnanchor">598</a>
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>and the other chiefs on this side the river Indus, to
bid them come and meet him as each might find it
convenient. Taxiles and the other chiefs accordingly
did come to meet him, bringing the gifts which are
reckoned of most value among the Indians. They said
that they would also present to him the elephants which
they had with them, twenty-five in number. There he
divided his army, and sent Hephaestion and Perdiccas
away into the land of Peucelaotis,<a name="FNanchor_599" id="FNanchor_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599" class="fnanchor">599</a> towards the river
Indus, with the brigades of Gorgias, Clitus,<a name="FNanchor_600" id="FNanchor_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600" class="fnanchor">600</a> and Meleager,
half of the Companion cavalry, and all the cavalry of the
Grecian mercenaries. He gave them instructions either
to capture the places on their route by force, or to bring
them over on terms of capitulation; and when they
reached the river Indus, to make the necessary preparations
for the passage of the army. With them Taxiles
and the other chiefs also marched. When they reached
the river Indus they carried out all Alexander’s orders.
But Astes, the ruler of the land of Peucelaotis, effected a
revolt, which both ruined himself and brought ruin also
upon the city into which he had fled for refuge. For
Hephaestion captured it after a siege of thirty days, and
Astes himself was killed. Sangaeus, who had some time
before fled from Astes and deserted to Taxiles, was appointed
to take charge of the city. This desertion was
a pledge to Alexander of his fidelity.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIII.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Battles with the Aspasians.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Alexander</span> now took command of the shield-bearing
guards, the Companion cavalry with the exception of
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>those who had been joined with Hephaestion’s division,
the regiments of what were called foot-Companions,
the archers, the Agrianians and the horse-lancers, and
advanced with them into the land of the Aspasians,
Guraeans and Assacenians.<a name="FNanchor_601" id="FNanchor_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601" class="fnanchor">601</a> Marching by a mountainous
and rough road along the river called Choes,<a name="FNanchor_602" id="FNanchor_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602" class="fnanchor">602</a> which he
crossed with difficulty, he ordered the main body of his
infantry to follow at leisure; while he himself took all the
cavalry, and 800 of the Macedonian infantry whom he
mounted upon horses with their infantry shields, and
made a forced march, because he had received information
that the barbarians who inhabited that district had
fled for safety into the mountains which extend through
the land and into as many of their cities as were strong
enough to resist attack. Assaulting the first of these
cities which was situated on his route, he routed, at the
first attack without any delay, the men whom he found
drawn up in front of the city, and shut them up in
it. He was himself wounded by a dart which penetrated
through the breastplate into his shoulder; but
the wound was only a slight one, for the breastplate
prevented the dart from penetrating right through
his shoulder. Leonnatus and Ptolemy, son of Lagus,
were also wounded. Then he encamped near the
city at the place where the wall seemed most easy to
assault. At dawn on the following day the Macedonians
easily forced their way through the first wall, as it had
not been strongly built. The city had been surrounded
with a double wall. At the second wall the barbarians
stood their ground for a short time; but when the
scaling ladders were now being fixed, and the defenders
were being wounded with darts from all sides, they no
longer stayed; but rushed through the gates out of the
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>city towards the mountains. Some of them were killed
in the flight, and the Macedonians, being enraged because
they had wounded Alexander, slew all whom they took
prisoners. Most of them, however, escaped into the
mountains, because they were not far from the city.
Having levelled this city with the ground, he marched
to another, named Audaca, which he got possession of by
capitulation. He left Craterus there with the other
commanders of the infantry to capture all the remaining
cities which would not yield of their own accord, and to
set the affairs of the whole country in such order as he
should find most convenient under the circumstances.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER XXIV.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Operations against the Aspasians.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Alexander</span> now took command of the shield-bearing
guards, the archers, the Agrianians, the brigade of
Coenus and Attalus, the royal body-guard of cavalry,
about four regiments of the other Companion cavalry,
and half of the horse-archers, and advanced towards the
river Euaspla,<a name="FNanchor_603" id="FNanchor_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603" class="fnanchor">603</a> where the chieftain of the Aspasians was.
After a long journey he arrived at the city on the second
day. When the barbarians ascertained that he was approaching
they set fire to the city and fled to the mountains.
But Alexander followed close upon the fugitives
as far as the mountains, and slaughtered many of them
before they could manage to get away into the places
which were difficult of access. Ptolemy, son of Lagus,
observing that the leader himself of the Indians of that
district was on a certain hill, and that he had some of
his shield-bearing guards round him, though he had with
himself far fewer men, yet he still continued to pursue
him on horseback. But as the hill was difficult for his
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>horse to run up, he left it there, handing it over to one
of the shield-bearing guards to lead. He then followed
the Indian on foot, without any delay. When the latter
observed Ptolemy approaching, he turned round, and so
did the shield-bearing guards with him. The Indian at
close quarters struck Ptolemy on the chest through the
breastplate with a long spear, but the breastplate checked
the violence of the blow. Then Ptolemy, smiting right
through the Indian’s thigh, overthrew him, and stripped
him of his arms. When his men saw their leader lying
dead, they stood their ground no longer; but the men on
the mountains, seeing their chieftain’s corpse being carried
off by the enemy, were seized with indignation, and
running down engaged in a desperate conflict over him
on the hill. For Alexander himself was now on the hill
with the infantry who had dismounted from the horses.
These, falling upon the Indians, drove them away to the
mountains after a hard struggle, and remained in possession
of the corpse. Then crossing the mountains he
descended to a city called Arigaeum, and found that this
had been set on fire by the inhabitants, who had afterwards
fled. There Craterus with his army reached him,
after accomplishing all the king’s orders; and because
this city seemed to be built in a convenient place, he
directed that general to fortify it well, and settle in it
as many of the neighbouring people as were willing to
live there, together with any of the soldiers who were
unfit for service. He then advanced to the place where
he heard that most of the barbarians of the district had
fled for refuge; and coming to a certain mountain, he
encamped at the foot of it. Meantime Ptolemy, son of
Lagus, being sent out by Alexander on a foraging expedition,
and advancing a considerable distance with a few
men to reconnoitre, brought back word to the king that
he had observed many more fires in the camp of the barbarians
than there were in Alexander’s. But the latter<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
did not believe in the multitude of the enemy’s fires.
Discovering, however, that the barbarians of the district
had joined their forces into one body, he left a part of
his army there near the mountain, encamped as they
were, and taking as many men as seemed sufficient, according
to the reports he had received, as soon as they
could descry the fires near at hand, he divided his army
into three parts. Over one part he placed Leonnatus,
the confidential body-guard, joining the brigades of
Attalus and Balacrus with his own; the second division
he put under the lead of Ptolemy, son of Lagus,
including the third part of the royal shield-bearing
guards, the brigades of Philip and Philotas, two regiments
of horse-archers, the Agrianians, and half of the
cavalry. The third division he himself led towards the
place where most of the barbarians were visible.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER XXV.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Defeat of the Aspasians.&mdash;The Assacenians and
Guraeans Attacked.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">When</span> the enemy who were occupying the commanding
heights perceived the Macedonians approaching, they
descended into the plain, being emboldened by their
superiority in number and despising the Macedonians,
because they were seen to be few. A sharp contest
ensued; but Alexander won the victory with ease.
Ptolemy’s men did not range themselves on the level
ground, for the barbarians were occupying a hill.
Wherefore Ptolemy, forming his battalions into column,
led them to the point where the hill seemed most easily
assailable, not surrounding it entirely, but leaving room
for the barbarians to flee if they were inclined to do so.
A sharp contest also ensued with these men, both from
the difficult nature of the ground, and because the Indians
are not like the other barbarians of this district,<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
but are far stronger than their neighbours. These men
also were driven away from the mountain by the Macedonians.
In the same way did Leonnatus with the third
division of the army; for his men also defeated those
opposed to them. Ptolemy indeed says that all the
men were captured, to a number exceeding 40,000, and
that 230,000 oxen were also taken, of which Alexander
picked out the finest, because they seemed to him to
excel both in beauty and size, wishing to send them into
Macedonia to till the soil. Thence he marched towards
the land of the Assacenians; for he received news that
these people had made preparations to fight him, having
20,000 cavalry, more than 30,000 infantry, and 30 elephants.
When Craterus had thoroughly fortified the
city, for the founding of which he had been left behind,
he brought the heavier armed men of his army for Alexander
as well as the military engines, in case it might
be necessary to lay siege to any place. Alexander then
marched against the Assacenians at the head of the
Companion cavalry, the horse-archers, the brigades of
Coenus and Polysperchon, the Agrianians, the light-armed
troops,<a name="FNanchor_604" id="FNanchor_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604" class="fnanchor">604</a> and the archers. Passing through the land
of the Guraeans, he crossed the river Guraeus,<a name="FNanchor_605" id="FNanchor_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605" class="fnanchor">605</a> which
gives its name to the land, with difficulty, both on account
of its depth, and because its current is swift, and
the stones in the river being round caused those who
stepped upon them to stumble.<a name="FNanchor_606" id="FNanchor_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606" class="fnanchor">606</a> When the barbarians
perceived Alexander approaching, they durst not take
their stand for a battle in close array, but dispersed one
by one to their various cities with the determination of
preserving these by resolute fighting.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Siege of Massaga.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">In</span> the first place Alexander led his forces against Massaga,<a name="FNanchor_607" id="FNanchor_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607" class="fnanchor">607</a>
the largest of the cities in that district; and when
he was approaching the walls, the barbarians being
emboldened by the mercenaries whom they had obtained
from the more distant Indians to the number of 7,000,
when they saw the Macedonians pitching their camp,
advanced against them with a run. Alexander, seeing
that the battle was about to be fought near the city, was
anxious to draw them further away from their walls, so
that if they were put to rout, as he knew they would
be, they might not be able easily to preserve themselves
by fleeing for refuge into the city close at hand. When
therefore he saw the barbarians running out, he ordered
the Macedonians to turn round and retreat to a certain
hill distant something about seven stades from the place
where he had resolved to encamp. The enemy being
emboldened, as if the Macedonians had already given
way, rushed upon them with a run and with no kind
of order. But when the arrows began to reach them,
Alexander at once wheeled round at the appointed signal,
and led his phalanx against them with a run. His
horse-lancers, Agrianians, and archers first ran forward
and engaged with the barbarians, while he himself led
the phalanx in regular order. The Indians were alarmed
at this unexpected manœuvre, and as soon as the
battle became a hand-to-hand conflict, they gave way
and fled into the city. About 200 of them were killed,
and the rest were shut up within the walls. Alexander
then led his phalanx up to the wall, from which he was
soon after slightly wounded in the ankle with an arrow.
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>On the next day he brought up his military engines and
easily battered down a piece of the wall; but the Indians
so gallantly kept back the Macedonians who were trying
to force an entrance where the breach had been made,
that he recalled the army for this day. But on the morrow
the Macedonians themselves made a more vigorous
assault, and a wooden tower was drawn up to the walls,
from which the archers shot at the Indians, and missiles
were hurled from the military engines which repulsed
them to a great distance. But not even thus were they
able to force their way within the wall. On the third
day he led the phalanx near again, and throwing a
bridge from a military engine over to the part of the
wall where the breach had been made, by this he led
up the shield-bearing guards, who had captured Tyre for
him in a similar way.<a name="FNanchor_608" id="FNanchor_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608" class="fnanchor">608</a> But as many were urged on by
their ardour, the bridge received too great a weight, and
was snapped asunder, so that the Macedonians fell with
it. The barbarians, seeing what was taking place, raised
a great shout, and shot at them from the wall with
stones, arrows, and whatever else any one happened to
have at hand, or whatever any one could lay hold of at
the time. Others issued forth by the small gates which
they had between the towers in the wall, and at close
quarters struck the men who had been thrown into confusion
by the fall.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER XXVII.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sieges of Massaga and Ora.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Alexander</span> now sent Alcetas with his own brigade to
recover the men who had been severely wounded, and to
recall to the camp those who were assailing the enemy.
On the fourth day he brought up another bridge against
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>the wall in like manner upon another military engine.
The Indians, as long as the ruler of the place survived,
defended themselves gallantly; but when he was struck
and killed with a missile hurled from an engine, and as
some of their number had fallen in the siege, which had
gone on without any cessation, while most of them were
wounded and unfit for service, they sent a herald to
Alexander. He was glad to preserve the lives of brave
men; so he came to terms with the Indian mercenaries
on this condition, that they should be admitted into the
ranks with the rest of his army and serve as his soldiers.
They therefore came out of the city with their arms, and
encamped by themselves upon a hill which was facing
the camp of the Macedonians; but they resolved to arise
by night and run away to their own abodes, because
they were unwilling to take up arms against the other
Indians. When Alexander received intelligence of this,
he placed the whole of his army round the hill in the
night, and intercepting them in the midst of their
flight, cut them to pieces. He then took the city by
storm, denuded as it was of defenders; and captured
the mother and daughter of Assacenus.<a name="FNanchor_609" id="FNanchor_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609" class="fnanchor">609</a> In the whole
siege five-and-twenty of Alexander’s men were killed.
Thence he despatched Coenus to Bazira,<a name="FNanchor_610" id="FNanchor_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610" class="fnanchor">610</a> entertaining an
opinion that the inhabitants would surrender, when they
heard of the capture of Massaga. He also despatched
Attalus, Alcetas, and Demetrius the cavalry officer to
another city, named Ora, with instructions to blockade
it until be himself arrived. The men of this city made
a sortie against the forces of Alcetas; but the Macedonians
easily routed them, and drove them into the city
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>within the wall. But affairs at Bazira were not favourable
to Coenus, for the inhabitants showed no sign of
capitulating, trusting to the strength of the place, because
not only was it situated on a lofty eminence, but
it was also thoroughly fortified all round. When Alexander
learnt this, he started off to Bazira; but ascertaining
that some of the neighbouring barbarians were
about to get into the city of Ora by stealth, being
despatched thither by Abisares<a name="FNanchor_611" id="FNanchor_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611" class="fnanchor">611</a> for that very purpose,
he first marched to Ora. He ordered Coenus to fortify
a certain strong position to serve as a basis of operations
against the city of Bazira, and then to come to him with
the rest of his army, after leaving in that place a sufficient
garrison to restrain the men in the city from enjoying
the free use of their land. But when the men
of Bazira saw Coenus departing with the larger part of
his army, they despised the Macedonians, as not being
able to contend with them, and sallied forth into the
plain. A sharply contested battle ensued, in which 500
of the barbarians fell, and over seventy were taken
prisoners. But the rest, fleeing for refuge into the city,<a name="FNanchor_612" id="FNanchor_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612" class="fnanchor">612</a>
were now more securely shut off from the country by
the men in the fort. The siege of Ora proved an easy
matter to Alexander, for he no sooner attacked the walls
than at the first assault he got possession of the city,
and captured the elephants which had been left there.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Capture of Bazira.&mdash;Advance to the Rock of Aornus.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">When</span> the men in Bazira heard this news, despairing of
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>their own affairs, they abandoned the city about the
middle of the night, and fled to the rock as the other
barbarians were doing. For all the inhabitants deserted
the cities and began to flee to the rock which is in their
land, and is called Aornus.<a name="FNanchor_613" id="FNanchor_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613" class="fnanchor">613</a> For stupendous is this
rock in this land, about which the current report is,
that it was found impregnable even by Heracles, the
son of Zeus. I cannot affirm with confidence either way,
whether the Theban, Tyrian, or Egyptian Heracles<a name="FNanchor_614" id="FNanchor_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614" class="fnanchor">614</a>
penetrated into India or not; but I am rather inclined
to think that he did not penetrate so far; for men are
wont to magnify the difficulty of difficult enterprises to
such a degree as to assert that they would have been
impracticable even to Heracles. Therefore, I am inclined
to think, that in regard to this rock the name of Heracles
was mentioned simply to add to the marvellousness of
the tale. The circuit of the rock is said to be about 200
stades (<i>i.e.</i> about twenty-three miles), and its height
where it is lowest, eleven stades (<i>i.e.</i>, about a mile and
a quarter). There was only one ascent, which was artificial
and difficult; on the summit of the rock there was
abundance of pure water, a spring issuing from the
ground, from which the water flowed; and there was
also timber, and sufficient good arable land for 1,000
men to till.<a name="FNanchor_615" id="FNanchor_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615" class="fnanchor">615</a> When Alexander heard this, he was seized
with a vehement desire to capture this mountain also,
especially on account of the legend which was current
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>about Heracles. He then made Ora and Massaga fortresses
to keep the land in subjection, and fortified the
city of Bazira. Hephaestion and Perdiccas also fortified
for him another city, named Orobatis, and leaving a
garrison in it marched towards the river Indus. When
they reached that river they at once began to carry
out Alexander’s instructions in regard to bridging it.
Alexander then appointed Nicanor, one of the Companions,
viceroy of the land on this side the river
Indus; and in the first place leading his army towards
that river, he brought over on terms of capitulation
the city of Peucelaotis, which was situated not far from
it. In this city he placed a garrison of Macedonians,
under the command of Philip, and then reduced to
subjection some other small towns situated near the
same river, being accompanied by Cophaeus and Assagetes,
the chieftains of the land. Arriving at the
city of Embolima,<a name="FNanchor_616" id="FNanchor_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616" class="fnanchor">616</a> which was situated near the rock
Aornus, be left Craterus there with a part of the army,
to gather as much corn as possible into the city, as well
as all the other things requisite for a long stay, so that
making this their base of operations, the Macedonians
might be able by a long siege to wear out the men who
were holding the rock, supposing it were not captured
at the first assault. He then took the bowmen, the
Agrianians, and the brigade of Coenus, and selecting the
lightest as well as the best-armed men from the rest of
the phalanx, with 200 of the Companion cavalry and 100
horse-bowmen, he advanced to the rock. This day he
encamped where it appeared to him convenient; but on
the morrow he approached a little nearer to the rock,
and encamped again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIX.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Siege of Aornus.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">At</span> this juncture some of the natives came to him, and
surrendering themselves, offered to lead him to the part
of the rock where it could be most easily assailed,
and from which it would be easy for him to capture the
place. With these he sent Ptolemy, son of Lagus, the
confidential body-guard, in command of the Agrianians
and the other light-armed troops, together with picked
men from the shield-bearing guards. He gave this
officer instructions, as soon as he had got possession of
the place, to occupy it with a strong guard, and signal
to him that it was held. Ptolemy proceeded along a
road which was rough and difficult to pass, and occupied
the position without the knowledge of the barbarians.
After strengthening his position with a stockade and a
ditch all round, he raised a beacon from the mountain,
whence it was likely to be seen by Alexander. The
flame was at once seen, and on the following day the
king led his army forward; but as the barbarians disputed
his advance, he could do nothing further on account
of the difficult nature of the ground. When the
barbarians perceived that Alexander could not make an
assault, they turned round and attacked Ptolemy, and
a sharp battle ensued between them and the Macedonians,
the Indians making great efforts to demolish
the stockade, and Ptolemy to preserve his position. But
the barbarians, getting the worst of it in the skirmish,
withdrew as the night came on. Alexander now selected
from the Indian deserters a man who was not only
devoted to him but acquainted with the locality,<a name="FNanchor_617" id="FNanchor_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617" class="fnanchor">617</a> and
sent him by night to Ptolemy, carrying a letter, in which
it was written that as soon as the king attacked the rock,
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>Ptolemy was to come down the mountain upon the barbarians,
and not be contented with holding his position in
guard; so that the Indians, being assailed from both sides
at once, might be in perplexity what course to pursue.
Accordingly, starting from his camp at daybreak, he led
his army up the path by which Ptolemy had ascended by
stealth, entertaining the opinion that if he could force
his way in this direction and join his forces with those
of Ptolemy, the work would no longer be difficult for
him; and so it turned out. For until midday a smart
battle was kept up between the Indians and the Macedonians,
the latter striving to force a way of approach,
and the former hurling missiles at them as they ascended.
But as the Macedonians did not relax their efforts,
advancing one after another, and those who were in
advance rested till their comrades came up, after great
exertions they gained possession of the pass early in the
afternoon, and formed a junction with Ptolemy’s forces.
As the whole army was now united, Alexander led it
thence against the rock itself. But the approach to it
was still impracticable. Such then was the result of this
day’s labours. At the approach of the dawn he issued
an order that each soldier individually should cut 100
stakes; and when this had been done he heaped up
a great mound against the rock, beginning from the top
of the hill where they had encamped. From this mound
he thought the arrows as well as the missiles launched
from the military engines would be able to reach the
defenders of the rock. Every one in the army assisted
him in this work of raising the mound; while he himself
superintended it, as an observer, not only commending
the man who completed his task with zeal and alacrity,
but also chastising him who was dilatory in the pressing
emergency.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXX.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Capture of Aornus.&mdash;Arrival at the Indus.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">On</span> the first day his army constructed the mound the
length of a stade; and on the following day the slingers
shooting at the Indians from the part already finished,
assisted by the missiles which were hurled from the
military engines, repulsed the sallies which they made
against the men who were constructing the mound. He
went on with the work for three days without intermission,
and on the fourth day a few of the Macedonians
forcing their way occupied a small eminence which was
on a level with the rock. Without taking any rest,
Alexander went on with the mound, being desirous of
connecting his artificial rampart with the eminence which
the few men were now occupying for him. But then the
Indians, being alarmed at the indescribable audacity of
the Macedonians, who had forced their way to the eminence,
and seeing that the mound was already united with
it, desisted from attempting any longer to resist. They
sent their herald to Alexander, saying that they were
willing to surrender the rock, if he would grant them a
truce. But they had formed the design of wasting the
day by continually delaying the ratification of the truce,
and of scattering themselves in the night with the view
of escaping one by one to their own abodes. When
Alexander discovered this plan of theirs, he allowed them
time to commence their retreat, and to remove the guard
which was placed all round the place. He remained quiet
until they began their retreat; then taking 700 of the
body-guards and shield-bearing infantry, he was the first
to scale the rock at the part of it abandoned by the enemy;
and the Macedonians ascended after him, one in one place
another in another, drawing each other up. These men at
the concerted signal turned themselves upon the retreating
barbarians, and killed many of them in their flight.<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
Others retreating with panic terror perished by leaping
down the precipices; and thus the rock which had been
inexpugnable to Heracles was occupied by Alexander.
He offered sacrifice upon it, and arranged a fort, committing
the superintendence of the garrison to Sisicottus,
who long before had deserted from the Indians to
Bessus in Bactra, and after Alexander had acquired possession
of the country of Bactra, entered his army and
appeared to be eminently trustworthy.</p>

<p>He now set out from the rock and invaded the land of
the Assacenians; for he was informed that the brother
of Assacenus, with his elephants and many of the neighbouring
barbarians had fled into the mountains in this
district. When he arrived at the city of Dyrta,<a name="FNanchor_618" id="FNanchor_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618" class="fnanchor">618</a> he
found none of the inhabitants either in it or in the land
adjacent. On the following day he sent out Nearchus
and Antiochus, the colonels of the shield-bearing guards,
giving the former the command of the Agrianians and
the light-armed troops,<a name="FNanchor_619" id="FNanchor_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619" class="fnanchor">619</a> and the latter the command of
his own regiments and two others besides. They were
despatched both to reconnoitre the locality and to try
if they could capture some of the barbarians anywhere
in order to get information about the general affairs of
the country; and he was especially anxious to learn news
of the elephants. He now directed his march towards
the river Indus,<a name="FNanchor_620" id="FNanchor_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620" class="fnanchor">620</a> the army going in advance to make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>a road for him, as otherwise this district would have
been impassable. Here he captured a few of the barbarians,
from whom he learnt that the Indians of that
land had fled for safety to Abisares, but that they had
left their elephants there to pasture near the river Indus.
He ordered these men to show him the way to the
elephants. Many of the Indians are elephant-hunters,
and these Alexander kept in attendance upon him in
high honour, going out to hunt the elephants in company
with them. Two of these animals perished in the chase,
by leaping down a precipice, but the rest were caught
and being ridden by drivers were marshalled with the
army. He also as he was marching along the river
lighted upon a wood the timber of which was suitable for
building ships; this was cut down by the army, and
ships were built for him, which were brought down the
river Indus to the bridge, which had long since been constructed
by Hephaestion and Perdiccas at his command.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Alexander at Nysa.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">In</span> this country, lying between the rivers Cophen and
Indus, which was traversed by Alexander, the city of
Nysa<a name="FNanchor_621" id="FNanchor_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621" class="fnanchor">621</a> is said to be situated. The report is, that its foundation
was the work of Dionysus, who built it after he
had subjugated the Indians.<a name="FNanchor_622" id="FNanchor_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622" class="fnanchor">622</a> But it is impossible to
determine who this Dionysus<a name="FNanchor_623" id="FNanchor_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623" class="fnanchor">623</a> was, and at what time, or
from what quarter he led an army against the Indians.
For I am unable to decide whether the Theban Dionysus,
starting from Thebes or from the Lydian Tmolus<a name="FNanchor_624" id="FNanchor_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624" class="fnanchor">624</a> came
into India at the head of an army, and after traversing
the territories of so many warlike nations, unknown to
the Greeks of that time, forcibly subjugated none of
them except that of the Indians. But I do not think
we ought to make a minute examination of the legends
which were promulgated in ancient times about the
divinity; for things which are not credible to the man
who examines them according to the rule of probability,
do not appear to be wholly incredible, if one adds the
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>divine agency to the story. When Alexander came to
Nysa the citizens sent out to him their president, whose
name was Acuphis, accompanied by thirty of their most
distinguished men as envoys, to entreat Alexander to
leave their city free for the sake of the god. The envoys
entered Alexander’s tent and found him seated in his
armour still covered with dust from the journey, with his
helmet on his head, and holding his spear in his hand.
When they beheld the sight they were struck with
astonishment, and falling to the earth remained silent
a long time. But when Alexander caused them to rise,
and bade them be of good courage, then at length
Acuphis began thus to speak: “The Nysaeans beseech
thee, O king, out of respect for Dionysus, to allow them
to remain free and independent; for when Dionysus had
subjugated the nation of the Indians, and was returning
to the Grecian sea, he founded this city from the soldiers
who had become unfit for military service, and were
under his inspiration as Bacchanals, so that it might be
a monument both of his wandering and of his victory,
to men of after times; just as thou also hast founded
Alexandria near mount Caucasus, and another Alexandria
in the country of the Egyptians. Many other cities
thou hast already founded, and others thou wilt found
hereafter, in the course of time, inasmuch as thou hast
achieved more exploits than Dionysus. The god indeed
called the city Nysa, and the land Nysaea after his
nurse Nysa. The mountain also which is near the city
he named Meros (i.e. thigh), because, according to the
legend, he grew in the thigh of Zeus. From that time
we inhabit Nysa, a free city, and we ourselves are independent,
conducting our government with constitutional
order. And let this be to thee a proof that our city
owes its foundation to Dionysus; for ivy, which does not
grow in the rest of the country of India, grows among
us.”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Alexander at Nysa.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">All</span> this was very pleasant to Alexander to hear; for he
wished that the legend about the wandering of Dionysus
should be believed, as well as that Nysa owed its foundation
to that deity, since he had himself reached the
place where Dionysus came, and had even advanced
beyond the limits of the latter’s march. He also thought
that the Macedonians would not decline still to share his
labours if he advanced further, from a desire to surpass
the achievements of Dionysus. He therefore granted the
inhabitants of Nysa the privilege of remaining free and
independent; and when he inquired about their laws, he
commended them because the government was in the
hands of the aristocracy. He required them to send
300 of their horsemen to accompany him, and to select
and send 100 of the aristocrats who presided over the
government of the State, who also were 300 in number.
He ordered Acuphis to make the selection, and appointed
him governor of the land of Nysaea. When Acuphis
heard this, he is said to have smiled at the speech;
whereupon Alexander asked him why he laughed.
Acuphis replied:&mdash;“How, O king, could a single city
deprived of 100 of its good men be still well governed?
But if thou carest for the welfare of the Nysaeans, lead
with thee the 300 horsemen, and still more than that
number if thou wishest: but instead of the hundred of
the best men whom thou orderest me to select lead with
thee double the number of the others who are bad, so
that when thou comest here again the city may appear<a name="FNanchor_625" id="FNanchor_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_625" class="fnanchor">625</a> in
the same good order in which it now is.” By these
remarks he persuaded Alexander; for he thought he
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>was speaking with prudence. So he ordered them to
send the horsemen to accompany him, but no longer
demanded the hundred select men, nor indeed others in
their stead. But he commanded Acuphis to send his
own son and his daughter’s son to accompany him. He
was now seized with a strong desire of seeing the place
where the Nysaeans boasted to have certain memorials
of Dionysus. So he went to Mount Merus with the
Companion cavalry and the foot guard, and saw the
mountain, which was quite covered with ivy and laurel
and groves thickly shaded with all sorts of timber, and
on it were chases of all kinds of wild animals.<a name="FNanchor_626" id="FNanchor_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626" class="fnanchor">626</a> The
Macedonians were delighted at seeing the ivy, as they
had not seen any for a long time; for in the land of the
Indians there was no ivy, even where they had vines.
They eagerly made garlands of it, and crowned themselves
with them, as they were, singing hymns in honour
of Dionysus, and invoking the deity by his various
names.<a name="FNanchor_627" id="FNanchor_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_627" class="fnanchor">627</a> Alexander there offered sacrifice to Dionysus,
and feasted in company with his companions.<a name="FNanchor_628" id="FNanchor_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_628" class="fnanchor">628</a> Some
authors have also stated, but I do not know if any one
will believe it, that many of the distinguished Macedonians
in attendance upon him, having crowned themselves
with ivy, while they were engaged in the invocation
of the deity, were seized with the inspiration of
Dionysus, uttered cries of Evoi in honour of the god,
and acted as Bacchanals.<a name="FNanchor_629" id="FNanchor_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629" class="fnanchor">629</a></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Incredulity of Eratosthenes.&mdash;Passage of the Indus.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Any</span> one who receives these stories may believe or disbelieve
them as he pleases. But I do not altogether
agree with Eratosthenes the Cyrenaean,<a name="FNanchor_630" id="FNanchor_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630" class="fnanchor">630</a> who says that
everything which was attributed to the divine agency by
the Macedonians was really said to gratify Alexander by
their excessive eulogy. For he says that the Macedonians,
seeing a cavern in the land of the Parapamisadians,<a name="FNanchor_631" id="FNanchor_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_631" class="fnanchor">631</a>
and hearing a certain legend which was current among
the natives, or themselves forming a conjecture, spread
the report that this forsooth was the cave where Prometheus
had been bound, that an eagle frequented it
to feast on his inward parts, that when Heracles arrived
there he killed the eagle and set Prometheus free from
his bonds. He also says that by their account the
Macedonians transferred Mount Caucasus from the
Euxine Sea to the eastern parts of the earth, and the
land of the Parapamisadians to that of the Indians;<a name="FNanchor_632" id="FNanchor_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_632" class="fnanchor">632</a>
calling what was really Mount Parapamisus by the name
of Caucasus, in order to enhance Alexander’s glory,
seeing that he forsooth had gone over the Caucasus.
He adds, that when they saw in India itself some oxen
marked with the brand of a club, they concluded from
this that Heracles had penetrated into India. Eratosthenes
also disbelieves the similar tale of the wandering
of Dionysus. Let me leave the stories about these
matters undecided as far as I am concerned.</p>

<p>When Alexander arrived at the river Indus, he found
a bridge made over it by Hephaestion, and two thirty-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>oared
galleys, besides many smaller craft.<a name="FNanchor_633" id="FNanchor_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_633" class="fnanchor">633</a> He moreover
found that 200 talents of silver,<a name="FNanchor_634" id="FNanchor_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_634" class="fnanchor">634</a> 3,000 oxen, above
10,000 sheep for sacrificial victims, and thirty elephants
had arrived as gifts from Taxiles the Indian; 700 Indian
horsemen also arrived from Taxiles as a reinforcement,
and that prince sent word that he would surrender to
him the city of Taxila,<a name="FNanchor_635" id="FNanchor_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635" class="fnanchor">635</a> the largest town between the
rivers Indus and Hydaspes.<a name="FNanchor_636" id="FNanchor_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636" class="fnanchor">636</a> Alexander there offered
sacrifice to the gods to whom he was in the habit of
sacrificing, and celebrated a gymnastic and horse contest
near the river. The sacrifices were favourable to his
crossing.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Digression about India.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">The</span> following are statements about the river Indus
which are quite unquestionable, and therefore let me
record them. The Indus is the largest of all the rivers
in Asia and Europe, except the Ganges,<a name="FNanchor_637" id="FNanchor_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637" class="fnanchor">637</a> which is also
an Indian river. It takes its rise on this side mount
Parapamisus, or Caucasus, and discharges its water into
the Great Sea which lies near India in the direction of
the south wind. It has two mouths, both of which
outlets are full of shallow pools like the five outlets of
the Ister (or Danube).<a name="FNanchor_638" id="FNanchor_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638" class="fnanchor">638</a> It forms a Delta in the land of
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>the Indians resembling that of Egypt<a name="FNanchor_639" id="FNanchor_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_639" class="fnanchor">639</a>; and this is
called Pattala in the Indian language. The Hydaspes,
Acesines, Hydraotes, and Hyphasis are also Indian
rivers,<a name="FNanchor_640" id="FNanchor_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640" class="fnanchor">640</a> and far exceed the other rivers of Asia in size;
but they are not only smaller but much smaller than the
Indus, just as that river itself is smaller than the Ganges.
Indeed Ctesias<a name="FNanchor_641" id="FNanchor_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641" class="fnanchor">641</a> says (if any one thinks his evidence to be
depended upon), that where the Indus is narrowest, its
banks are forty stades apart; where it is broadest, 100
stades; and most of it is the mean between these
breadths.<a name="FNanchor_642" id="FNanchor_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642" class="fnanchor">642</a> This river Indus Alexander crossed at daybreak
with his army into the country of the Indians;
concerning whom, in this history I have described
neither what laws they enjoy, nor what strange animals
their land produces, nor how many and what sort of fish
and water-monsters are produced by the Indus, Hydaspes,
Ganges, or the other rivers of India. Nor have I
described the ants which dig up the gold for them,<a name="FNanchor_643" id="FNanchor_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643" class="fnanchor">643</a> nor
the guardian griffins, nor any of the other tales that have
been composed rather to amuse than to be received as
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>the relation of facts; since the falsity of the strange
stories which have been fabricated about India cannot be
exposed by any one.<a name="FNanchor_644" id="FNanchor_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_644" class="fnanchor">644</a> However, Alexander and those who
served in his army exposed the falsity of most of these
tales; but there were even some of these very men who
fabricated other stories. They proved that the Indians
whom Alexander visited with his army, and he visited
many tribes of them, were destitute of gold; and also
that they were by no means luxurious in their mode of
living. Moreover, they discovered that they were tall in
stature, in fact as tall as any men throughout Asia, most
of them being five cubits in height, or a little less. They
were blacker than the rest of men, except the Ethiopians<a name="FNanchor_645" id="FNanchor_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645" class="fnanchor">645</a>;
and in war they were far the bravest of all
the races inhabiting Asia at that time. For I cannot
with any justice compare the race of the ancient Persians
with those of India, though at the head of the former
Cyrus, son of Cambyses, set out and deprived the Medes
of the empire of Asia, and subdued many other races
partly by force and partly by voluntary surrender on
their own part. For at that time the Persians were a
poor people and inhabitants of a rugged land, having
laws and customs very similar to the Laconian discipline.<a name="FNanchor_646" id="FNanchor_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_646" class="fnanchor">646</a>
Nor am I able with certainty to conjecture
whether the defeat sustained by the Persians in the
Scythian land was due to the difficult nature of the
country invaded or to some other error on the part of
Cyrus, or whether the Persians were really inferior in
warlike matters to the Scythians of that district.</p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">But</span> of the Indians I shall treat in a distinct work,<a name="FNanchor_647" id="FNanchor_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647" class="fnanchor">647</a>
giving the most credible accounts which were compiled
by those who accompanied Alexander in his expedition,
as well as by Nearchus,<a name="FNanchor_648" id="FNanchor_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_648" class="fnanchor">648</a> who sailed right round the Great
Sea which is near India. Then I shall add what has been
compiled by Megasthenes<a name="FNanchor_649" id="FNanchor_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_649" class="fnanchor">649</a> and Eratosthenes, two men
of distinguished authority. I shall describe the customs
peculiar to the Indians and the strange animals which
are produced in the country, as well as the voyage itself
in the external sea. But now let me describe so much
only as appears to me sufficient to explain Alexander’s
achievements. Mount Taurus divides Asia, beginning
from Mycale, the mountain which lies opposite the island
of Samos; then, cutting through the country of the
Pamphylians and Cilicians, it extends into Armenia.
From this country it stretches into Media and through the
land of the Parthians and Chorasmians. In Bactria it
unites with mount Parapamisus, which the Macedonians
who served in Alexander’s army called Caucasus, in order,
as it is said, to enhance their king’s glory; asserting that
he went even beyond the Caucasus with his victorious arms.
Perhaps it is a fact that this mountain range is a continuation
of the other Caucasus in Scythia, as the Taurus<a name="FNanchor_650" id="FNanchor_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650" class="fnanchor">650</a>
is of the same. For this reason I have on a previous
occasion called this range Caucasus, and by the same
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>name I shall continue to call it in the future. This
Caucasus extends as far as the Great Sea which lies in
the direction of India and the East. Of the rivers in
Asia worth consideration which take their rise from the
Taurus and Caucasus, some have their course turned
towards the north, discharging themselves either into
the lake Maeotis,<a name="FNanchor_651" id="FNanchor_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651" class="fnanchor">651</a> or into the sea called Hyrcanian,
which in reality is a gulf of the Great Sea.<a name="FNanchor_652" id="FNanchor_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652" class="fnanchor">652</a> Others flow
towards the south, namely, the Euphrates, Tigres, Indus,
Hydaspes, Acesines, Hydraotes, Hyphasis, and all those
that lie between these and the river Ganges. All these
either discharge their water into the sea, or disappear
by pouring themselves out into marshes, as the river
Euphrates<a name="FNanchor_653" id="FNanchor_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_653" class="fnanchor">653</a> does.</p>

<hr />

<h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">General Description of India.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Whoever</span> arranges the position of Asia in such a way
that it is divided by the Taurus and the Caucasus from
the west wind to the east wind, will find that these two
very large divisions are made by the Taurus itself, one of
which is inclined towards the south and the south wind,
and the other towards the north and the north wind.
Southern Asia again may be divided into four parts, of
which Eratosthenes and Megasthenes make India the
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>largest. The latter author lived with Sibyrtius,<a name="FNanchor_654" id="FNanchor_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654" class="fnanchor">654</a> the
viceroy of Arachosia, and says that he frequently visited
Sandracotus, king of the Indians.<a name="FNanchor_655" id="FNanchor_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655" class="fnanchor">655</a> These authors say
that the smallest of the four parts is that which is
bounded by the river Euphrates and extends to our
inland sea. The other two lying between the rivers
Euphrates and Indus are scarcely worthy to be compared
with India, if they were joined together. They say that
India is bounded towards the east and the east wind as
far as the south by the Great Sea, towards the north by
mount Caucasus, as far as its junction with the Taurus;
and that the river Indus cuts it off towards the west and
the north-west wind, as far as the Great Sea. The
greater part of it is a plain, which, as they conjecture,
has been formed by the alluvial deposits of the rivers;
just as the plains in the rest of the earth lying near the
sea are for the most part due to the alluvial action of the
rivers taken singly. Consequently, the names by which
the countries are called were attached in ancient times
to the rivers. For instance, a certain plain was called
after the Hermus, which rises in the country of Asia
from the mountain of Mother Dindymene,<a name="FNanchor_656" id="FNanchor_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_656" class="fnanchor">656</a> and after
flowing past the Aeolian city of Smyrna discharges its
water into the sea. Another Lydian plain is named
after the Caÿster, a Lydian river; another from the
Caïcus in Mysia; and the Carian plain, extending as far
as the Ionian city of Miletus, is named from the
Maeander. Both Herodotus and Hecataeus<a name="FNanchor_657" id="FNanchor_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_657" class="fnanchor">657</a> the his<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>torians
(unless the work about the Egyptian country
is by another person, and not by Hecataeus) in like
manner call Egypt a gift of the river<a name="FNanchor_658" id="FNanchor_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_658" class="fnanchor">658</a>; and Herodotus
has shown by no uncertain proofs that such is the case<a name="FNanchor_659" id="FNanchor_659"></a><a href="#Footnote_659" class="fnanchor">659</a>;
so that even the country itself perhaps received its name
from the river. For that the river which both the
Egyptians and men outside Egypt now name the Nile,
was in ancient times called Aegyptus, Homer is sufficient
to prove; since he says that Menelaüs stationed his ships
at the outlet of the river Aegyptus.<a name="FNanchor_660" id="FNanchor_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_660" class="fnanchor">660</a> If therefore single
rivers by themselves, and those not large ones, are
sufficient to form an extensive tract of country, while
flowing forward into the sea, since they carry down slime
and mud from the higher districts whence they derive
their sources, surely it is unbecoming to exhibit incredulity
about India, how it has come to pass that most
of it is a plain, which has been formed by the alluvial
deposits of its rivers. For if the Hermus, the Caÿster,
the Caïcus, the Maeander, and all the other<a name="FNanchor_661" id="FNanchor_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_661" class="fnanchor">661</a> rivers of
Asia which discharge their waters into the midland sea
were all put together, they would not be worthy of
comparison for volume of water with one of the Indian
rivers. Not only do I mean the Ganges, which is the
largest, and with which neither the water of the Egyptian
Nile nor the Ister flowing through Europe is worthy to
compare; but if all those rivers were mingled together
they would not even then become equal to the river
Indus, which is a large river as soon as it issues from
its springs, and after receiving fifteen rivers,<a name="FNanchor_662" id="FNanchor_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_662" class="fnanchor">662</a> all larger
than those in the province of Asia, discharges its water
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>into the sea, retaining its own name and absorbing those
of its tributaries. Let these remarks which I have made
about India suffice for the present, and let the rest be
reserved for my “Description of India.”</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER VII.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Method of Bridging Rivers.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">How</span> Alexander constructed his bridge over the river
Indus, is explained neither by Aristobulus nor Ptolemy,
authors whom I usually follow; nor am I able to form
a decided opinion whether the passage was bridged with
boats, as the Hellespont was by Xerxes and the Bosporus
and the Ister were by Darius,<a name="FNanchor_663" id="FNanchor_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_663" class="fnanchor">663</a> or whether he made a
continuous bridge over the river. To me it seems probable
that the bridge was made of boats; for the depth
of the water would not have admitted of the construction
of a regular bridge, nor could so enormous a work have
been completed in so short a time.<a name="FNanchor_664" id="FNanchor_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_664" class="fnanchor">664</a> If the passage was
bridged with boats, I cannot decide whether the vessels
being fastened together with ropes and moored in a row
were sufficient to form the bridge, as Herodotus the
Halicarnassian says the Hellespont was bridged, or
whether the work was effected in the way in which the
bridge upon the Ister and that upon the Celtic Rhine<a name="FNanchor_665" id="FNanchor_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_665" class="fnanchor">665</a>
are made by the Romans, and in the way in which they
bridged the Euphrates and Tigres, as often as necessity
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>compelled them. However, as I know myself, the
Romans find the quickest way of making a bridge to
be with vessels; and this method I shall on the present
occasion explain, because it is worth describing. At a
pre-concerted signal they let the vessels loose down the
stream, not with their prows forward, but as if backing
water.<a name="FNanchor_666" id="FNanchor_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_666" class="fnanchor">666</a> As might naturally be expected, the stream
carries them down, but a skiff furnished with oars holds
them back, until it settles them in the place assigned
to them. Then pyramidal wicker-baskets made of willow,
full of unhewn stones, are let down into the water from
the prow of each vessel, in order to hold it up against
the force of the stream. As soon as any one of these
vessels has been held fast, another is in the same way
moored with its prow against the stream, distant from
the first as far as is consistent with their supporting
what is put upon them. On both of them are placed
pieces of timber with sharp ends projecting out, on
which cross-planks are placed to bind them together;
and so proceeds the work through all the vessels which
are required to bridge the river. At each end of this
bridge firmly fixed gangways are thrown forward,<a name="FNanchor_667" id="FNanchor_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_667" class="fnanchor">667</a> so
that the approach may be safer for the horses and beasts
of burden, and at the same time to serve as a bond
to the bridge. In a short time the whole is finished
with a great noise and bustle; but yet discipline is not
relaxed while the work is going on. In each vessel the
exhortations of the overseers to the men, or their censures
of sluggishness, neither prevent the orders being heard
nor impede the rapidity of the work.<a name="FNanchor_668" id="FNanchor_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_668" class="fnanchor">668</a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">March from the Indus to the Hydaspes.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">This</span> has been the method of constructing bridges,
practised by the Romans from olden times; but how
Alexander laid a bridge over the river Indus I cannot
say, because those who served in his army have said
nothing about it. But I should think that the bridge
was made as near as possible as I have described, or
if it were effected by some other contrivance so let it be.
When Alexander had crossed to the other side of the
river Indus, he again offered sacrifice there, according
to his custom.<a name="FNanchor_669" id="FNanchor_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_669" class="fnanchor">669</a> Then starting from the Indus, he
arrived at Taxila, a large and prosperous city, in fact
the largest of those situated between the rivers Indus
and Hydaspes. He was received in a friendly manner
by Taxiles, the governor of the city, and by the Indians
of that place; and he added to their territory as much
of the adjacent country as they asked for. Thither also
came to him envoys from Abisares, king of the mountaineer
Indians, the embassy including the brother of
Abisares as well as the other most notable men. Other
envoys also came from Doxareus, the chief of the province,
bringing gifts with them. Here again at Taxila
Alexander offered the sacrifices which were customary
for him to offer, and celebrated a gymnastic and equestrian
contest. Having appointed Philip, son of Machatas,
viceroy of the Indians of that district, he left a garrison
in Taxila, as well as the soldiers who were invalided by
sickness, and then marched towards the river Hydaspes.
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>For he was informed that Porus,<a name="FNanchor_670" id="FNanchor_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_670" class="fnanchor">670</a> with the whole of his
army was on the other side of that river, having determined
either to prevent him from making the passage,
or to attack him while crossing. When Alexander
ascertained this, he sent Coenus, son of Polemocrates,
back to the river Indus, with instructions to cut in
pieces all the vessels which he had prepared for the
passage of that river, and to bring them to the river
Hydaspes. Coenus cut the vessels in pieces and conveyed
them thither, the smaller ones being cut into two
parts, and the thirty-oared galleys into three. The
sections were conveyed upon waggons, as far as the bank
of the Hydaspes; and there the vessels were fixed
together again, and seen as a fleet upon that river.
Alexander took the forces which he had when he arrived
at Taxila, and the 5,000 Indians under the command
of Taxiles and the chiefs of that district, and marched
towards the same river.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER IX.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Porus obstructs Alexander’s Passage.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Alexander</span> encamped on the bank of the Hydaspes, and
Porus was seen with all his army and his large troop of
elephants lining the opposite bank.<a name="FNanchor_671" id="FNanchor_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_671" class="fnanchor">671</a> He remained to
guard the passage at the place where he saw Alexander
had encamped; and sent guards to all the other parts
of the river which were easily fordable, placing officers
over each detachment, being resolved to obstruct the
passage of the Macedonians. When Alexander saw this,
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>he thought it advisable to move his army in various
directions, to distract the attention of Porus, and render
him uncertain what to do. Dividing his army into many
parts, he led some of his troops now in one direction
and now in another, at one time ravaging the enemy’s
country, at another looking out for a place where the
river might appear easier for him to ford it. The rest
of his troops he entrusted<a name="FNanchor_672" id="FNanchor_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_672" class="fnanchor">672</a> to his different generals, and
sent them about in many directions. He also conveyed
corn from all quarters into his camp from the land on
this side the Hydaspes, so that it might be evident to
Porus that he had resolved to remain quiet near the
bank until the water of the river subsided in the winter,
and afforded him a passage in many places. As his
vessels were sailing up and down the river, and skins
were being filled with hay, and the whole bank appeared
to be covered in one place with cavalry and in another
with infantry, Porus was not allowed to keep at rest,
or to bring his preparations together from all sides to
any one point if he selected this as suitable for the
defence of the passage. Besides at this season all the
Indian rivers were flowing with swollen and turbid
waters and with rapid currents; for it was the time of
year when the sun is wont to turn towards the summer
solstice.<a name="FNanchor_673" id="FNanchor_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_673" class="fnanchor">673</a> At this season incessant and heavy rain falls
in India; and the snows on the Caucasus, whence most
of the rivers have their sources, melt and swell their
streams to a great degree. But in the winter they again
subside, become small and clear, and are fordable in
certain places, with the exception of the Indus, Ganges,
and perhaps one or two others. At any rate the
Hydaspes becomes fordable.</p>

<hr />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span></p><h3>CHAPTER X.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Alexander and Porus at the Hydaspes.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Alexander</span> therefore spread a report that he would wait
for that season of the year, if his passage was obstructed
at the present time; but yet all the time be was waiting
in ambush to see whether by rapidity of movement he
could steal a passage anywhere without being observed.
But he perceived that it was impossible for him to cross
at the place where Porus himself had encamped near
the bank of the Hydaspes, not only on account of the
multitude of his elephants, but also because his large
army, arranged in order of battle and splendidly accoutred,
was ready to attack his men as they emerged from the
water. Moreover he thought that his horses would not
be willing to mount the opposite bank, because the
elephants would at once fall upon them and frighten
them both by their aspect and trumpeting; nor even
before that would they remain upon the inflated hides
during the passage of the river; but when they looked
across and saw the elephants they would become frantic
and leap into the water. He therefore resolved to steal
a crossing by the following manœuvre:&mdash;In the night
he led most of his cavalry along the bank in various
directions, making a clamour and raising the battle-cry
in honour of Enyalius.<a name="FNanchor_674" id="FNanchor_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_674" class="fnanchor">674</a> Every kind of noise was raised,
as if they were making all the preparations necessary
for crossing the river. Porus also marched along the
river at the head of his elephants opposite the places where
the clamour was heard, and Alexander thus gradually got
him into the habit of leading his men along opposite the
noise. But when this occurred frequently, and there
was merely a clamour and a raising of the battle-cry,
Porus no longer continued to move about to meet the
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>expected advance of the cavalry; but perceiving that
his fear had been groundless,<a name="FNanchor_675" id="FNanchor_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_675" class="fnanchor">675</a> he kept his position in
the camp. However he posted his scouts at many places
along the bank. When Alexander had brought it about
that the mind of Porus no longer entertained any fear
of his nocturnal attempts, he devised the following
stratagem.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER XI.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Alexander’s Stratagem to Get Across.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">There</span> was in the bank of the Hydaspes, a projecting
headland, where the river makes a remarkable bend. It
was densely covered by a grove,<a name="FNanchor_676" id="FNanchor_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_676" class="fnanchor">676</a> containing all sorts of
trees; and over against it in the river was an island
full of trees and without a foot-track, on account of its
being uninhabited. Perceiving that this island was
right in front of the headland, and that both the spots
were woody and adapted to conceal his attempt to cross
the river, he resolved to convey his army over at this
place. The headland and island were 150 stades distant
from his great camp.<a name="FNanchor_677" id="FNanchor_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_677" class="fnanchor">677</a> Along the whole of the bank,
he posted sentries, separated as far as was consistent
with keeping each other in sight, and easily hearing
when any order should be sent along from any quarter.
From all sides also during many nights clamours were
raised and fires were burnt. But when he had made up
his mind to undertake the passage of the river, he openly
prepared his measures for crossing opposite the camp.
Craterus had been left behind at the camp with his own
division of cavalry, and the horsemen from the Arachotians
and Parapamisadians, as well as the brigades of
Alcetas and Polysperchon from the phalanx of the
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>Macedonian infantry, together with the chiefs of the
Indians dwelling this side of the Hyphasis, who had with
them 5,000 men. He gave Craterus orders not to cross
the river before Porus moved off with his forces against
them, or before be ascertained that Porus was in flight
and that they were victorious.<a name="FNanchor_678" id="FNanchor_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_678" class="fnanchor">678</a> “If however,” said he,
“Porus should take only a part of his army and march
against me, and leave the other part with the elephants
in his camp, in that case do thou also remain in thy
present position. But if he leads all his elephants with
him against me, and a part of the rest of his army is
left behind in the camp, then do thou cross the river
with all speed. For it is the elephants alone,” said he,
“which render it impossible for the horses to land on the
other bank. The rest of the army can easily cross.”</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER XII.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Passage of the Hydaspes.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Such</span> were the injunctions laid upon Craterus. Between
the island and the great camp where Alexander had left
this general, he posted Meleager, Attalus, and Gorgias,
with the Grecian mercenaries, cavalry and infantry,
giving them instructions to cross in detachments, breaking
up the army as soon as they saw the Indians already
involved in battle. He then picked the select body-guard
called the Companions, as well as the cavalry
regiments of Hephaestion, Perdiccas, and Demetrius, the
cavalry from Bactria, Sogdiana, and Scythia, and the
Daan horse-archers; and from the phalanx of infantry
the shield-bearing guards, the brigades of Clitus and
Coenus, with the archers and Agrianians, and made a
secret march, keeping far away from the bank of the river,
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>in order not to be seen marching towards the island
and headland, from which he had determined to cross.
There the skins were filled in the night with the hay
which had been procured long before, and they were
tightly stitched up. In the night a furious storm of rain
occurred, by which his preparations and attempt to cross
were rendered still more unobserved, since the noise of
the thunder and the storm drowned with its din the
clatter of the weapons and the noise which arose from the
orders given by the officers. Most of the vessels, the
thirty-oared galleys included with the rest, had been cut
in pieces by his order and conveyed to this place, where
they had been fixed together again<a name="FNanchor_679" id="FNanchor_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_679" class="fnanchor">679</a> and hidden in the
wood. At the approach of daylight, both the wind and
the rain calmed down; and the rest of the army went
over opposite the island, the cavalry mounting upon the
skins, and as many of the foot soldiers as the boats would
receive getting into them. They went so secretly that
they were not observed by the sentinels posted by Porus,
before they had already got beyond the island and were
only a little way from the other bank.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER XIII.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Passage of the Hydaspes.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Alexander</span> himself embarked in a thirty-oared galley and
went over, accompanied by Perdiccas, Lysimachus, the
confidential body-guards, Seleucus, one of the Companions,
who was afterwards king,<a name="FNanchor_680" id="FNanchor_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_680" class="fnanchor">680</a> and half of the shield-bearing
guards; the rest of these troops being conveyed in
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>other galleys of the same size. When the soldiers got
beyond the island, they openly directed their course to
the bank; and when the sentinels perceived that they had
started, they at once rode off to Porus as fast as each
man’s horse could gallop. Alexander himself was the
first to land, and he at once took the cavalry as they
kept on landing from his own and the other thirty-oared
galleys, and drew them up in proper order. For the
cavalry had received orders to land first; and at the head
of these in regular array he advanced. But through
ignorance of the locality he had effected a landing on
ground which was not a part of the mainland, but an
island, a large one indeed and where from the fact that it
was an island, he more easily escaped notice. It was
cut off from the rest of the land by a part of the river
where the water was shallow. However, the furious
storm of rain, which lasted the greater part of the night,
had swelled the water so much that his cavalry could not
find out the ford; and he was afraid that he would have
to undergo another labour in crossing as great as the
first. But when at last the ford was found, he led his
men through it with much difficulty; for where the water
was deepest, it reached higher than the breasts of the
infantry; and of the horses only the heads rose above the
river.<a name="FNanchor_681" id="FNanchor_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_681" class="fnanchor">681</a> When he had also crossed this piece of water,
he selected the choice guard of cavalry, and the best men
from the other cavalry regiments, and brought them up
from column into line on the right wing.<a name="FNanchor_682" id="FNanchor_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_682" class="fnanchor">682</a> In front of all
the cavalry he posted the horse-archers, and placed next
to the cavalry in front of the other infantry the royal
shield-bearing guards under the command of Seleucus.
Near these he placed the royal foot-guard, and next to
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>these the other shield-bearing guards, as each happened
at the time to have the right of precedence. On each
side, at the extremities of the phalanx, his archers, Agrianians
and javelin-throwers were posted.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIV.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Battle at the Hydaspes.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Having</span> thus arranged his army, he ordered the infantry
to follow at a slow pace and in regular order, numbering
as it did not much under 6,000 men; and because he
thought he was superior in cavalry, he took only his
horse-soldiers, who were 5,000 in number, and led them
forward with speed. He also instructed Tauron, the
commander of the archers, to lead them on also with speed
to back up the cavalry. He had come to the conclusion
that if Porus should engage him with all his forces, he
would easily be able to overcome him by attacking with
his cavalry, or to stand on the defensive until his infantry
arrived in the course of the action; but if the Indians
should be alarmed at his extraordinary audacity in making
the passage of the river and take to flight, he would
be able to keep close to them in their flight, so that the
slaughter of them in the retreat being greater, there
would be only a slight work left for him. Aristobulus
says that the son of Porus arrived with about sixty
chariots, before Alexander made his later passage from
the large island, and that he could have hindered Alexander’s
crossing (for he made the passage with difficulty
even when no one opposed him); if the Indians had
leaped down from their chariots and assaulted those who
first emerged from the water. But he passed by with
the chariots and thus made the passage quite safe for
Alexander; who on reaching the bank discharged his
horse-archers against the Indians in the chariots, and
these were easily put to rout, many of them being<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
wounded. Other writers say that a battle took place
between the Indians who came with the son of Porus and
Alexander at the head of his cavalry, that the son of
Porus came with a greater force, that Alexander himself
was wounded by him, and that his horse Bucephalas,
of which he was exceedingly fond, was killed, being
wounded, like his master by the son of Porus. But
Ptolemy, son of Lagus, with whom I agree, gives a
different account. This author also says that Porus despatched
his son, but not at the head of merely sixty
chariots; nor is it indeed likely that Porus hearing from
his scouts that either Alexander himself or at any rate a
part of his army had effected the passage of the Hydaspes,
would despatch his son against him with only sixty
chariots. These indeed were too many to be sent out as
a reconnoitring party, and not adapted for speedy retreat;
but they were by no means a sufficient force to
keep back those of the enemy who had not yet got across,
as well as to attack those who had already landed. Ptolemy
says that the son of Porus arrived at the head of
2000 cavalry and 120 chariots; but that Alexander had
already made even the last passage from the island before
he appeared.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER XV.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Arrangements of Porus.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Ptolemy</span> also says that Alexander in the first place sent
the horse-archers against these, and led the cavalry himself,
thinking that Porus was approaching with all his
forces, and that this body of cavalry was marching in
front of the rest of his army, being drawn up by him as
the vanguard. But as soon as he had ascertained with
accuracy the number of the Indians, he immediately made
a rapid charge upon them with the cavalry around him.
When they perceived that Alexander himself and the<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
body of cavalry around him had made the assault, not in
line of battle regularly formed, but by squadrons, they
gave way; and 400 of their cavalry, including the son
of Porus, fell in the contest. The chariots also were
captured, horses and all, being heavy and slow in the
retreat, and useless in the action itself on account of the
clayey ground. When the horsemen who had escaped
from this rout brought news to Porus that Alexander
himself had crossed the river with the strongest part of
his army, and that his son had been slain in the battle,
he nevertheless could not make up his mind what course
to take, because the men who had been left behind under
Craterus were seen to be attempting to cross the river
from the great camp which was directly opposite his
position. However, at last he preferred to march against
Alexander himself with all his army, and to come into a
decisive conflict with the strongest division of the Macedonians,
commanded by the king in person. But nevertheless
he left a few of the elephants together with a
small army there at the camp to frighten the cavalry
under Craterus from the bank of the river. He then
took all his cavalry to the number of 4,000 men, all his
chariots to the number of 300, with 200 of his elephants
and 30,000 choice infantry, and marched against Alexander.
When he found a place where he saw there was
no clay, but that on account of the sand the ground was
all level and hard, and thus fit for the advance and retreat
of horses, he there drew up his army. First he placed
the elephants in the front, each animal being not less than
a plethrum<a name="FNanchor_683" id="FNanchor_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_683" class="fnanchor">683</a> apart, so that they might be extended in
the front before the whole of the phalanx of infantry, and
produce terror everywhere among Alexander’s cavalry.
Besides he thought that none of the enemy would have
the audacity to push themselves into the spaces between
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>the elephants, the cavalry being deterred by the fright of
their horses; and still less would the infantry do so, it being
likely they would be kept off in front by the heavy-armed
soldiers falling upon them, and trampled down by the
elephants wheeling round against them. Near these he
had posted the infantry, not occupying a line on a level
with the beasts, but in a second line behind them, only
so far distant that the companies of foot might be pushed
forward a short distance into the spaces between them.
He had also bodies of infantry standing beyond the elephants
on the wings; and on both sides of the infantry he
had posted the cavalry, in front of which were placed the
chariots on both wings of his army.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER XVI.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Alexander’s Tactics.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Such</span> was the arrangement which Porus made of his
forces. As soon as Alexander observed that the Indians
were drawn up in order of battle, he stopped his cavalry
from advancing farther, so that he might take up the
infantry as it kept on arriving; and even when the
phalanx in quick march had effected a junction with the
cavalry, he did not at once draw it out and lead it to the
attack, not wishing to hand over his men exhausted with
fatigue and out of breath, to the barbarians who were
fresh and untired. On the contrary, he caused his infantry
to rest until their strength was recruited, riding along
round the lines to inspect them.<a name="FNanchor_684" id="FNanchor_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_684" class="fnanchor">684</a> When he had surveyed
the arrangement of the Indians, he resolved not
to advance against the centre, in front of which the elephants
had been posted, and in the gaps between them
a dense phalanx of men; for he was alarmed at the very
arrangements which Porus had made here with that
express design. But as he was superior in the number
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>of his cavalry, he took the greater part of that force,
and marched along against the left wing of the enemy
for the purpose of making an attack in this direction.
Against the right wing he sent Coenus with his own
regiment of cavalry and that of Demetrius, with instructions
to keep close behind the barbarians when they,
seeing the dense mass of cavalry opposed to them, should
ride out to fight them. Seleucus, Antigenes, and Tauron
were ordered to lead the phalanx of infantry, but not to
engage in the action until they observed<a name="FNanchor_685" id="FNanchor_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_685" class="fnanchor">685</a> the enemy’s
cavalry and phalanx of infantry thrown into disorder by
the cavalry under his own command. But when they came
within range of missiles, he launched the horse-archers,
1000 in number, against the left wing of the Indians, in
order to throw those of the enemy who were posted there
into confusion by the incessant storm of arrows and by
the charge of the horses. He himself with the Companion
cavalry marched along rapidly against the left wing of
the barbarians, being eager to attack them in flank while
still in a state of disorder, before their cavalry could be
deployed.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER XVII.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Defeat of Porus.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Meantime</span> the Indians had collected their cavalry from all
parts, and were riding along, advancing out of their position
to meet Alexander’s charge. Coenus also appeared
with his men in their rear, according to his instructions.
The Indians, observing this, were compelled to make the
line of their cavalry face both ways<a name="FNanchor_686" id="FNanchor_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_686" class="fnanchor">686</a>; the largest and
best part against Alexander, while the rest wheeled round
against Coenus and his forces. This therefore at once
threw the ranks as well as the decisions of the Indians
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>into confusion. Alexander, seeing his opportunity, at the
very moment the cavalry was wheeling round in the
other direction, made an attack on those opposed to him
with such vigour that the Indians could not sustain the
charge of his cavalry, but were scattered and driven to
the elephants, as to a friendly wall, for refuge. Upon
this, the drivers of the elephants urged forward the beasts
against the cavalry; but now the phalanx itself of the
Macedonians was advancing against the elephants, the
men casting darts at the riders and also striking the
beasts themselves, standing round them on all sides. The
action was unlike any of the previous contests; for wherever
the beasts could wheel round, they rushed forth
against the ranks of infantry and demolished the phalanx
of the Macedonians, dense as it was. The Indian cavalry
also, seeing that the infantry were engaged in the action,
rallied again and advanced against the Macedonian
cavalry. But when Alexander’s men, who far excelled
both in strength and military discipline, got the mastery
over them the second time, they were again repulsed
towards the elephants and cooped up among them. By
this time the whole of Alexander’s cavalry had collected
into one squadron, not by any command of his, but having
settled into this arrangement by the mere effect of
the struggle itself; and wherever it fell upon the ranks
of the Indians they were broken up with great slaughter.
The beasts being now cooped up into a narrow space,
their friends were no less injured by them than their foes,
being trampled down in their wheeling and pushing
about. Accordingly there ensued a great slaughter of
the cavalry, cooped up as it was in a narrow space around
the elephants. Most of the keepers of the elephants
had been killed by the javelins, and some of the elephants
themselves had been wounded, while others no longer
kept apart in the battle on account of their sufferings or
from being destitute of keepers. But, as if frantic with<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
pain, rushing forward at friends and foes alike, they
pushed about, trampled down and killed them in every
kind of way. However, the Macedonians retired whenever
they were assailed, for they rushed at the beasts in
a more open space, and in accordance with their own
plan; and when they wheeled round to return, they followed
them closely and hurled javelins at them; whereas
the Indians retreating among them were now receiving
greater injury from them. But when the beasts were
tired out, and they were no longer able to charge with
any vigour, they began to retire, facing the foe like ships
backing water, merely uttering a shrill piping sound.
Alexander himself surrounded the whole line with his
cavalry, and gave the signal that the infantry should link
their shields together so as to form a very densely closed
body, and thus advance in phalanx. By this means the
Indian cavalry, with the exception of a few men, was quite
cut up in the action; as was also the infantry, since the
Macedonians were now pressing upon them from all sides.
Upon this, all who could do so turned to flight through
the spaces which intervened between the parts of Alexander’s
cavalry.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER XVIII.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Losses of the Combatants.&mdash;Porus Surrenders.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">At</span> the same time Craterus and the other officers of
Alexander’s army who had been left behind on the
bank of the Hydaspes crossed the river, when they
perceived that Alexander was winning a brilliant victory.
These men, being fresh, followed up the pursuit instead
of Alexander’s exhausted troops, and made no less a
slaughter of the Indians in their retreat. Of the Indians
little short of 20,000 infantry and 3,000 cavalry were
killed in this battle.<a name="FNanchor_687" id="FNanchor_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_687" class="fnanchor">687</a> All their chariots were broken
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>to pieces; and two sons of Porus were slain, as were
also Spitaces, the governor of the Indians of that district,
the managers of the elephants and of the chariots, and
all the cavalry officers and generals of Porus’s army.
All the elephants which were not killed there, were
captured. Of Alexander’s forces, about 80 of the 6,000
foot-soldiers who were engaged in the first attack, were
killed; 10 of the horse-archers, who were also the first
to engage in the action; about 20 of the Companion
cavalry, and about 200 of the other horsemen fell.<a name="FNanchor_688" id="FNanchor_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_688" class="fnanchor">688</a>
When Porus, who exhibited great talent in the battle,
performing the deeds not only of a general but also of
a valiant soldier, observed the slaughter of his cavalry,
and some of his elephants lying dead, others destitute
of keepers straying about in a forlorn condition, while
most of his infantry had perished, he did not depart as
Darius the Great King did, setting an example of flight
to his men; but as long as any body of Indians remained
compact in the battle, he kept up the struggle. But at
last, having received a wound on the right shoulder,
which part of his body alone was unprotected during the
battle, he wheeled round. His coat of mail warded off
the missiles from the rest of his body, being extraordinary
both for its strength and the close fitting of its joints,
as it was afterwards possible for those who saw him to
observe. Then indeed he turned his elephant round and
began to retire. Alexander, having seen that he was a
great man and valiant in the battle, was very desirous of
saving his life. He accordingly sent first to him Taxiles
the Indian; who rode up as near to the elephant which
was carrying Porus as seemed to him safe, and bade him
stop the beast, assuring him that it was no longer
possible for him to flee, and bidding him listen to Alex<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>ander’s
message. But when he saw his old foe Taxiles,
he wheeled round and was preparing to strike him with a
javelin; and he would probably have killed him, if he
had not quickly driven his horse forward out of the reach
of Porus before he could strike him. But not even on
this account was Alexander angry with Porus; but he
kept on sending others in succession; and last of all
Meroës an Indian, because he ascertained that he was an
old friend of Porus. As soon as the latter heard the
message brought to him by Meroës, being at the same
time overcome by thirst, he stopped his elephant and
dismounted from it. After he had drunk some water
and felt refreshed, he ordered Meroës to lead him without
delay to Alexander; and Meroës led him thither.<a name="FNanchor_689" id="FNanchor_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_689" class="fnanchor">689</a></p>

<hr />

<h3>CHAPTER XIX.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Alliance with Porus.&mdash;Death of Bucephalas.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">When</span> Alexander heard that Meroës was bringing Porus
to him, he rode in front of the line with a few of the
Companions to meet Porus; and stopping his horse, he
admired his handsome figure and his stature,<a name="FNanchor_690" id="FNanchor_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_690" class="fnanchor">690</a> which
reached somewhat above five cubits. He was also surprised
that he did not seem to be cowed in spirit,<a name="FNanchor_691" id="FNanchor_691"></a><a href="#Footnote_691" class="fnanchor">691</a> but
advanced to meet him as one brave man would meet
another brave man, after having gallantly struggled in
defence of his own kingdom against another king. Then
indeed Alexander was the first to speak, bidding him
say what treatment he would like to receive. The report
goes that Porus replied: “Treat me, O Alexander, in a
kingly way!” Alexander being pleased at the expres<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>sion,
said: “For my own sake, O Porus, thou shalt be
thus treated; but for thy own sake do thou demand
what is pleasing to thee!” But Porus said that everything
was included in that. Alexander, being still more
pleased at this remark, not only granted him the rule over
his own Indians, but also added another country to that
which he had before, of larger extent than the former.<a name="FNanchor_692" id="FNanchor_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_692" class="fnanchor">692</a>
Thus he treated the brave man in a kingly way, and from
that time found him faithful in all things. Such was the
result of Alexander’s battle with Porus and the Indians
living beyond the river Hydaspes, which was fought in
the archonship of Hegemon at Athens, in the month
Munychion<a name="FNanchor_693" id="FNanchor_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_693" class="fnanchor">693</a> (18 April to 18 May, 326 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>).</p>

<p>Alexander founded two cities, one where the battle
took place, and the other on the spot whence he started
to cross the river Hydaspes; the former he named Nicaea,<a name="FNanchor_694" id="FNanchor_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_694" class="fnanchor">694</a>
after his victory over the Indians, and the latter Bucephala
in memory of his horse Bucephalas, which died
there, not from having been wounded by any one, but
from the effects of toil and old age; for he was about
thirty years old, and quite worn out with toil.<a name="FNanchor_695" id="FNanchor_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_695" class="fnanchor">695</a> This
Bucephalas had shared many hardships and incurred
many dangers with Alexander during many years, being
ridden by none but the king, because he rejected all
other riders. He was both of unusual size and generous
in mettle. The head of an ox had been engraved upon
him as a distinguishing mark, and according to some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
this was the reason why he bore that name; but others
say, that though he was black he had a white mark upon
his head which bore a great resemblance to the head of
an ox. In the land of the Uxians this horse vanished
from Alexander, who thereupon sent a proclamation
throughout the country that he would kill all the inhabitants,
unless they brought the horse back to him.
As a result of this proclamation it was immediately
brought back. So great was Alexander’s attachment to
the horse, and so great was the fear of Alexander entertained
by the barbarians.<a name="FNanchor_696" id="FNanchor_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_696" class="fnanchor">696</a> Let so much honour be paid
by me to this Bucephalas for the sake of his master.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER XX.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Conquest of the Glausians.&mdash;Embassy from Abisares.&mdash;Passage
of the Acesines.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">When</span> Alexander had paid all due honours to those who
had been killed in the battle, he offered the customary
sacrifices to the gods in gratitude for his victory, and
celebrated a gymnastic and horse contest upon the bank
of the Hydaspes at the place where he first crossed with
his army.<a name="FNanchor_697" id="FNanchor_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_697" class="fnanchor">697</a> He then left Craterus behind with a part of
the army, to erect and fortify the cities which he was
founding there; but he himself marched against the
Indians conterminous with the dominion of Porus.
According to Aristobulus the name of this nation was
Glauganicians; but Ptolemy calls them Glausians. I
am quite indifferent which name it bore. Alexander
traversed their land with half the Companion cavalry, the
picked men from each phalanx of the infantry, all the
horse-bowmen, the Agrianians, and the archers. All the
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>inhabitants came over to him on terms of capitulation;
and he thus took thirty-seven cities, the inhabitants of
which, where they were fewest, amounted to no less than
5,000, and those of many numbered above 10,000. He
also took many villages, which were no less populous
than the cities. This land also he granted to Porus to
rule; and sent Taxiles back to his own abode after
affecting a reconciliation between him and Porus. At
this time arrived envoys from Abisares,<a name="FNanchor_698" id="FNanchor_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_698" class="fnanchor">698</a> who told him
that their king was ready to surrender himself and the
land which he ruled. And yet before the battle which
was fought between Alexander and Porus, Abisares
intended to join his forces with those of the latter. On
this occasion he sent his brother with the other envoys
to Alexander, taking with them money and forty
elephants as a gift. Envoys also arrived from the
independent Indians, and from a certain other Indian
ruler named Porus.<a name="FNanchor_699" id="FNanchor_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_699" class="fnanchor">699</a> Alexander ordered Abisares to
come to him as soon as possible, threatening that unless
he came he would see him arrive with his army at a place
where he would not rejoice to see him. At this time
Phrataphernes, viceroy of Parthia and Hyrcania, came to
Alexander at the head of the Thracians who had been
left with him. Messengers also came from Sisicottus,
viceroy of the Assacenians, to inform him that those
people had slain their governor and revolted from
Alexander. Against these he despatched Philip and
Tyriaspes with an army, to arrange and set in order the
affairs of their land.</p>

<p>He himself advanced towards the river Acesines.<a name="FNanchor_700" id="FNanchor_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_700" class="fnanchor">700</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>Ptolemy, son of Lagus, has described the size of this river
alone of those in India, stating that where Alexander
crossed it with his army upon boats and skins, the
stream was rapid and the channel was full of large and
sharp rocks, over which the water being violently carried
seethed and dashed. He says also that its breadth
amounted to fifteen stades; that those who went over
upon skins had an easy passage; but that not a few of
those who crossed in the boats perished there in the
water, many of the boats being wrecked upon the rocks
and dashed to pieces. From this description then it
would be possible for one to come to a conclusion by
comparison, that the size of the river Indus has been
stated not far from the fact by those who think that its
mean breadth is forty stades, but that it contracts to
fifteen stades where it is narrowest and therefore deepest;
and that this is the width of the Indus in many places.
I come then to the conclusion that Alexander chose a
part of the Acesines where the passage was widest, so
that he might find the stream slower than elsewhere.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER XXI.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Advance Beyond the Hydraotes.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">After</span> crossing the river,<a name="FNanchor_701" id="FNanchor_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_701" class="fnanchor">701</a> he left Coenus with his own
brigade there upon the bank, with instructions to superintend
the passage of the part of the army which had been
left behind for the purpose of collecting<a name="FNanchor_702" id="FNanchor_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_702" class="fnanchor">702</a> corn and other
supplies from the country of the Indians which was
already subject to him. He now sent Porus away to his
own abode, commanding him to select the most warlike
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>of the Indians and take all the elephants he had and
come to him. He resolved to pursue the other Porus,
the bad one, with the lightest troops in his army, because
he was informed that he had left the land which he ruled
and had fled. For this Porus, while hostilities subsisted
between Alexander and the other Porus, sent envoys to
Alexander offering to surrender both himself and the land
subject to him, rather out of enmity to Porus than from
friendship to Alexander. But when he ascertained that
the former had been released, and that he was ruling
over another large country in addition to his own, then,
fearing not so much Alexander as the other Porus, his
namesake, he fled from his own land, taking with him as
many of his warriors as he could persuade to share his
flight. Against this man Alexander marched, and arrived
at the Hydraotes,<a name="FNanchor_703" id="FNanchor_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_703" class="fnanchor">703</a> which is another Indian river, not
less than the Acesines in breadth, but less in swiftness of
current. He traversed the whole country as far as the
Hydraotes, leaving garrisons in the most suitable places,
in order that Craterus and Coenus might advance with
safety, scouring most of the land for forage. Then he
despatched Hephaestion into the land of the Porus
who had revolted, giving him a part of the army,
comprising two brigades of infantry, his own regiment of
cavalry with that of Demetrius and half of the archers,
with instructions to hand the country over to the other
Porus, to subdue any independent tribes of Indians
which dwelt near the banks of the river Hydraotes, and
to give them also into the hands of Porus to rule. He
himself then crossed the river Hydraotes, not with difficulty,
as he had crossed the Acesines. As he was
advancing into the country beyond the Hydraotes, it
happened that most of the people yielded themselves up
on terms of capitulation; but some came to meet him with
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>arms, while others who tried to escape he captured and
forcibly reduced to obedience.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER XXII.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Invasion of the Land of the Cathaeans.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Meantime</span> he received information that the tribe called
Cathaeans and some other tribes of the independent
Indians were preparing for battle, if he approached their
land; and that they were summoning to the enterprise
all the tribes conterminous with them who were in like
manner independent. He was also informed that the
city, Sangala by name,<a name="FNanchor_704" id="FNanchor_704"></a><a href="#Footnote_704" class="fnanchor">704</a> near which they were thinking of
having the struggle, was a strong one. The Cathaeans
themselves were considered very daring and skilful in
war; and two other tribes of Indians, the Oxydracians
and Mallians, were in the same temper as the Cathaeans.
For a short time before it happened that Porus and
Abisares had marched against them with their own
forces and had roused many other tribes of the independent
Indians to arms, but were forced to retreat
without effecting anything worthy of the preparations
they had made. When Alexander was informed of this,
he made a forced march against the Cathaeans, and on
the second day after starting from the river Hydraotes
he arrived at a city called Pimprama, inhabited by a tribe
of Indians named Adraistaeans, who yielded to him on
terms of capitulation. Giving his army a rest the next
day, he advanced on the third day to Sangala, where the
Cathaeans and the other neighbouring tribes had assembled
and marshalled themselves in front of the city
upon a hill which was not precipitous on all sides. They
had posted their waggons all round this hill and were
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>encamping within them in such a way that they were
surrounded by a triple palisade of waggons. When
Alexander perceived the great number of the barbarians
and the nature of their position, he drew up his forces in
the order which seemed to him especially adapted to his
present circumstances, and sent his horse-archers at once
without any delay against them, ordering them to ride
along and shoot at them from a distance; so that the
Indians might not be able to make any sortie, before his
army was in proper array, and that even before the
battle commenced they might be wounded within their
stronghold. Upon the right wing he posted the guard
of cavalry and the cavalry regiment of Clitus; next to
these the shield-bearing guards, and then the Agrianians.
Towards the left he had stationed Perdiccas with his own
regiment of cavalry, and the battalions of foot Companions.
The archers he divided into two parts and placed them
on each wing. While he was marshalling his army, the
infantry and cavalry of the rear-guard came up. Of these,
he divided the cavalry into two parts and led them to
the wings, and with the infantry which came up he made
the ranks of the phalanx more dense and compact. He
then took the cavalry which had been drawn up on the
right, and led it towards the waggons on the left wing of
the Indians; for here their position seemed to him more
easy to assail, and the waggons had not been placed
together so densely.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER XXIII.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Assault upon Sangala.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">As</span> the Indians did not run out from behind the waggons
against the advancing cavalry, but mounted upon them
and began to shoot from the top of them, Alexander,
perceiving that it was not the work for cavalry, leaped<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
down from his horse, and on foot led the phalanx of infantry
against them. The Macedonians without difficulty
forced the Indians from the first row of waggons; but
then the Indians, taking their stand in front of the second
row, more easily repulsed the attack, because they were
posted in denser array in a smaller circle. Moreover the
Macedonians were attacking them likewise in a confined
space, while the Indians were secretly creeping under the
front row of waggons, and without regard to discipline
were assaulting their enemy through the gaps left between
the waggons as each man found a chance.<a name="FNanchor_705" id="FNanchor_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_705" class="fnanchor">705</a> But nevertheless
even from these the Indians were forcibly driven
by the phalanx of infantry. They no longer made a
stand at the third row, but fled as fast as possible into
the city and shut themselves up in it. During that day
Alexander with his infantry encamped round the city,
as much of it, at least, as his phalanx could surround;
for he could not with his camp completely encircle the
wall, so extensive was it. Opposite the part unenclosed
by his camp, near which also was a lake, he posted the
cavalry, placing them all round the lake, which he discovered
to be shallow. Moreover, he conjectured that
the Indians, being terrified at their previous defeat, would
abandon the city in the night; and it turned out just as
he had conjectured; for about the second watch of the
night most of them dropped down from the wall, but fell
in with<a name="FNanchor_706" id="FNanchor_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_706" class="fnanchor">706</a> the sentinels of cavalry. The foremost of them
were cut to pieces by these; but the men behind them
perceiving that the lake was guarded all round, withdrew
into the city again. Alexander now surrounded
the city with a double stockade, except in the part where
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>the lake shut it in, and round the lake he posted more
perfect guards. He also resolved to bring military
engines up to the wall, to batter it down. But some of
the men in the city deserted to him, and told him that
the Indians intended that very night to steal out of the
city and escape by the lake, where the gap in the stockade
existed. He accordingly stationed Ptolemy, son of
Lagus, there, giving him three regiments of the shield-bearing
guards, all the Agrianians, and one line of archers,
pointing out to him the place where he especially conjectured
the barbarians would try to force their way.
“When thou perceivest the barbarians forcing their way
here,” said he, “do thou, with the army obstruct their
advance, and order the bugler to give the signal. And
do you, O officers, as soon as the signal has been given,
each being arrayed in battle order with your own men,
advance towards the noise, wherever the bugle summons
you. Nor will I myself withdraw from the action.”</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER XXIV.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Capture of Sangala.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Such</span> were the orders he gave; and Ptolemy collected
there as many waggons as he could from those which
had been left behind in the first flight, and placed them
athwart, so that there might seem to the fugitives in the
night to be many difficulties in their way; and as the
stockade had been knocked down, or had not been firmly
fixed in the ground, he ordered his men to heap up a
mound of earth in various places between the lake and
the wall. This his soldiers effected in the night. When
it was about the fourth watch,<a name="FNanchor_707" id="FNanchor_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_707" class="fnanchor">707</a> the barbarians, just as
Alexander had been informed, opened the gates towards
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>the lake, and made a run in that direction. However
they did not escape the notice of the guards there, nor
that of Ptolemy, who had been placed behind them to
render aid. But at this moment the buglers gave him
the signal, and he advanced against the barbarians with
his army fully equipped and drawn up in battle array.
Moreover the waggons and the stockade which had been
placed in the intervening space, were an obstruction to
them. When the bugle sounded and Ptolemy attacked
them, killing the men as they kept on stealing out through
the waggons, then indeed they were driven back again
into the city; and in their retreat 500 of them were killed.
In the meanwhile Porus arrived, bringing with him the
elephants that were left to him, and 5,000 Indians.
Alexander had constructed his military engines and they
were being led up to the wall; but before any of it was
battered down, the Macedonians took the city by storm,
digging under the wall, which was made of brick, and
placing scaling ladders against it all round. In the capture
17,000 of the Indians were killed, and above 70,000
were captured, besides 300 chariots and 500 cavalry. In
the whole siege a little less than 100 of Alexander’s army
were killed; but the number of the wounded was greater
than the proportion of the slain, being more than 1,200,
among whom were Lysimachus, the confidential body-guard,
and other officers. After burying the dead according
to his custom, Alexander sent Eumenes, the secretary,<a name="FNanchor_708" id="FNanchor_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_708" class="fnanchor">708</a>
with 300 cavalry to the two cities which had joined
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>Sangala in revolt, to tell those who held them about the
capture of Sangala, and to inform them that they would
receive no harsh treatment from Alexander if they stayed
there and received him as a friend; for no harm had
happened to any of the other independent Indians who
had surrendered to him of their own accord. But they
had become frightened, and had abandoned the cities
and were fleeing; for the news had already reached them
that Alexander had taken Sangala by storm. When
Alexander was informed of their flight he pursued them
with speed; but most of them were too quick for him,
and effected their escape, because the pursuit began from
a distant starting-place. But all those who were left
behind in the retreat from weakness, were seized by the
army and killed, to the number of about 500. Then,
giving up the design of pursuing the fugitives any
further, he returned to Sangala, and razed the city to
the ground. He added the land to that of the Indians
who had formerly been independent, but who had then
voluntarily submitted to him. He then sent Porus with
his forces to the cities which had submitted to him, to
introduce garrisons into them; whilst he himself, with
his army, advanced to the river Hyphasis,<a name="FNanchor_709" id="FNanchor_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_709" class="fnanchor">709</a> to subjugate
the Indians beyond it. Nor did there seem to him any
end of the war, so long as anything hostile to him remained.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER XXV.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Army Refuses to Advance.&mdash;Alexander’s Speech
to the Officers.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">It</span> was reported that the country beyond the river
Hyphasis was fertile, and that the men were good agri<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>culturists,
and gallant in war; and that they conducted
their own political affairs in a regular and constitutional
manner. For the multitude was ruled by the aristocracy,
who governed in no respect contrary to the rules of
moderation. It was also stated that the men of that
district possessed a much greater number of elephants
than the other Indians, and that those men were of very
great stature, and excelled in valour. These reports excited
in Alexander an ardent desire to advance farther;
but the spirit of the Macedonians now began to flag,
when they saw the king raising one labour after another,
and incurring one danger after another. Conferences
were held throughout the camp, in which those who were
the most moderate bewailed their lot, while others resolutely
declared that they would not follow Alexander any
farther, even if he should lead the way. When he heard
of this, before the disorder and pusillanimity of the
soldiers should advance to a great degree, be called a
council of the officers of the brigades and addressed
them as follows:&mdash;“O Macedonians and Grecian allies,
seeing that you no longer follow me into dangerous enterprises
with a resolution equal to that which formerly
animated you, I have collected you together into the
same spot, so that I may either persuade you to march
forward with me, or may be persuaded by you to return.
If indeed the labours which you have already undergone
up to our present position seem to you worthy of disapprobation,
and if you do not approve of my leading
you into them, there can be no advantage in my speaking
any further. But, if as the result of these labours,
you hold possession of Ionia,<a name="FNanchor_710" id="FNanchor_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_710" class="fnanchor">710</a> the Hellespont, both the
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>Phrygias, Cappadocia, Paphlagonia, Lydia, Caria, Lycia,
Pamphylia, Phoenicia, Egypt together with Grecian Libya,
as well as part of Arabia, Hollow Syria, Syria between
the rivers,<a name="FNanchor_711" id="FNanchor_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_711" class="fnanchor">711</a> Babylon, the nation of the Susians, Persia,
Media, besides all the nations which the Persians and the
Medes ruled, and many of those which they did not rule,
the land beyond the Caspian Gates, the country beyond
the Caucasus, the Tanais, as well as the land beyond that
river, Bactria, Hyrcania, and the Hyrcanian Sea; if we
have also subdued the Scythians as far as the desert; if,
in addition to these, the river Indus flows through our
territory, as do also the Hydaspes, the Acesines, and the
Hydraotes, why do ye shrink from adding the Hyphasis
also, and the nations beyond this river, to your empire
of Macedonia? Do ye fear that your advance will be
stopped in the future by any other barbarians? Of
whom some submit to us of their own accord, and others
are captured in the act of fleeing, while others, succeeding
in their efforts to escape, hand over to us their
deserted land, which we add to that of our allies, or to
that of those who have voluntarily submitted to us.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER XXVI.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Alexander’s Speech</span> (<i>continued</i>).</p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">“I, for</span> my part, think, that to a brave man there is no
end to labours except the labours themselves, provided
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>they lead to glorious achievements. But if any one
desires to hear what will be the end to the warfare itself,
let him learn that the distance still remaining before we
reach the river Ganges and the Eastern Sea is not great;
and I inform you that the Hyrcanian Sea will be seen to
be united with this, because the Great Sea encircles the
whole earth. I will also demonstrate both to the Macedonians
and to the Grecian allies, that the Indian Gulf is
confluent with the Persian, and the Hyrcanian Sea with
the Indian Gulf. From the Persian Gulf our expedition
will sail round into Libya as far as the Pillars of
Heracles.<a name="FNanchor_712" id="FNanchor_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_712" class="fnanchor">712</a> From the pillars all the interior of Libya<a name="FNanchor_713" id="FNanchor_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_713" class="fnanchor">713</a>
becomes ours, and so the whole of Asia<a name="FNanchor_714" id="FNanchor_714"></a><a href="#Footnote_714" class="fnanchor">714</a> will belong to
us, and the limits of our empire, in that direction, will be
those which God has made also the limits of the earth.
But, if we now return, many warlike nations are left unconquered
beyond the Hyphasis as far as the Eastern
Sea, and many besides between these and Hyrcania in
the direction of the north wind, and not far from these
the Scythian races. Wherefore, if we go back, there is
reason to fear that the races which are now held in subjection,
not being firm in their allegiance, may be excited
to revolt by those who are not yet subdued. Then our
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>many labours will prove to have been in vain; or it will
be necessary for us to incur over again fresh labours and
dangers, as at the beginning. But, O Macedonians and
Grecian allies, stand firm! Glorious are the deeds of
those who undergo labour and run the risk of danger;
and it is delightful to live a life of valour and to die
leaving behind immortal glory. Do ye not know that
our ancestor<a name="FNanchor_715" id="FNanchor_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_715" class="fnanchor">715</a> reached so great a height of glory as from
being a man to become a god, or to seem to become one,
not by remaining in Tiryns<a name="FNanchor_716" id="FNanchor_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_716" class="fnanchor">716</a> or Argos, or even in the
Peloponnese or at Thebes? The labours of Dionysus
were not few, and he was too exalted a deity to be compared
with Heracles. But we, indeed, have penetrated
into regions beyond Nysa<a name="FNanchor_717" id="FNanchor_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_717" class="fnanchor">717</a>; and the rock of Aornus,
which Heracles was unable to capture, is in our possession.
Do ye also add the parts of Asia still left unsubdued
to those already acquired, the few to the many.
But what great or glorious deed could we have performed,
if, sitting at ease in Macedonia, we had thought it
sufficient to preserve our own country without any labour,
simply repelling the attacks of the nations on our frontiers,
the Thracians, Illyrians, and Triballians, or even
those Greeks who were unfriendly to our interests? If,
indeed, without undergoing labour and being free from
danger I were acting as your commander, while you were
undergoing labour and incurring danger, not without
reason would you be growing faint in spirit and resolution,
because you alone would be sharing the labours,
while procuring the rewards of them for others. But
now the labours are common to you and me, we have an
equal share of the dangers, and the rewards are open to
the free competition of all. For the land is yours, and
you act as its viceroys. The greater part also of the
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>money now comes to you; and when we have traversed
the whole of Asia, then, by Zeus, not merely having
satisfied your expectations, but having even exceeded the
advantages which each man hopes to receive, those of you
who wish to return home I will send back to their own
land, or I will myself lead them back; while those who
remain here, I will make objects of envy to those who go
back.”<a name="FNanchor_718" id="FNanchor_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_718" class="fnanchor">718</a></p>

<hr />

<h3>CHAPTER XXVII.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Answer of Coenus.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">When</span> Alexander had uttered these remarks, and others
in the same strain, a long silence ensued, for the auditors
neither had the audacity to speak in opposition to the
king without constraint, nor did they wish to acquiesce
in his proposal. Hereupon, he repeatedly urged any one
who wished it, to speak, if he entertained different views
from those which he had himself expressed. Nevertheless
the silence still continued a long time; but at last,
Coenus, son of Polemocrates, plucked up courage and
spoke as follows<a name="FNanchor_719" id="FNanchor_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_719" class="fnanchor">719</a>:&mdash;“O king, inasmuch as thou dost not
wish to rule Macedonians by compulsion, but sayest thou
wilt lead them by persuasion, or yielding to their persuasion
wilt not use violence towards them, I am going to
make a speech, not on my own behalf and that of my
colleagues here present, who are held in greater honour
than the other soldiers, and most of us have already
carried off the rewards of our labours, and from our preeminence
are more zealous than the rest to serve thee in
all things; but I am going to speak on behalf of the
bulk of the army. On behalf of this army I am not going
to say what may be gratifying to the men, but what I
consider to be both advantageous to thee at present, and
safest for the future. I feel it incumbent upon me not
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>to conceal what I think the best course to pursue, both
on account of my age, the honour paid to me by the rest
of the army at thy behest, and the boldness which I
have without any hesitation displayed up to the present
time in incurring dangers and undergoing labours.
The more numerous and the greater the exploits have
been, which were achieved by thee as our commander,
and by those who started from home with thee, the more
advantageous does it seem to me that some end should
be put to our labours and dangers. For thou thyself
seest how many Macedonians and Greeks started with
thee, and how few of us have been left. Of our number
thou didst well in sending back home the Thessalians at
once from Bactra, because thou didst perceive that they
were no longer eager to undergo labours.<a name="FNanchor_720" id="FNanchor_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_720" class="fnanchor">720</a> Of the other
Greeks, some have been settled as colonists in the cities
which thou hast founded; where they remain not indeed
all of them of their own free will. The Macedonian
soldiers and the other Greeks who still continued to
share our labours and dangers, have either perished in
the battles, become unfit for war on account of their
wounds, or been left behind in the different parts of Asia.
The majority, however, have perished from disease, so that
few are left out of many; and these few are no longer
equally vigorous in body, while in spirit they are much
more exhausted. All those whose parents still survive,
feel a great yearning to see them once more; they feel a
yearning after their wives and children, and a yearning
for their native land itself; which it is surely pardonable
for them to yearn to see again with the honour and
dignity they have acquired from thee, returning as great
men, whereas they departed small, and as rich men instead
of being poor. Do not lead us now against our
will; for thou wilt no longer find us the same men in
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>regard to dangers, since free-will will be wanting to us
in the contests. But, rather, if it seem good to thee,
return to thy own land, see thy mother, regulate the affairs
of the Greeks, and carry to the home of thy fathers
these victories so many and great. Then start afresh on
another expedition, if thou wishest, against these very
tribes of Indians situated towards the east; or, if thou
wishest, into the Euxine Sea<a name="FNanchor_721" id="FNanchor_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_721" class="fnanchor">721</a>; or else against Carchedon
and the parts of Libya beyond the Carchedonians.<a name="FNanchor_722" id="FNanchor_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_722" class="fnanchor">722</a> It
is now thy business to manage these matters; and the
other Macedonians and Greeks will follow thee, young
men in place of old, fresh men in place of exhausted
ones, and men to whom warfare has no terrors, because
up to the present time they have had no experience of
it; and they will be eager to set out, from hope of future
reward. The probability also is, that they will accompany
thee with still more zeal on this account, when
they see that those who in the earlier expedition shared
thy labours and dangers have returned to their own abodes
as rich men instead of being poor, and renowned instead
of being obscure as they were before. Self-control in
the midst of success is the noblest of all virtues, O king!
For thou hast nothing to fear from enemies, while thou
art commanding and leading such an army as this; but
the visitations of the deity are unexpected, and consequently
men can take no precautions against them.”</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Alexander Resolves to Return.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">When</span> Coenus had concluded this speech, loud applause
was given to his words by those who were present; and
the fact that many even shed tears, made it still more
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>evident that they were disinclined to incur further
hazards, and that return would be delightful to them.
Alexander then broke up the conference, being annoyed
at the freedom of speech in which Coenus indulged, and
the hesitation displayed by the other officers. But the
next day he called the same men together again in wrath,
and told them that he intended to advance farther, but
would not force any Macedonian to accompany him
against his will; that he would have those only who
followed their king of their own accord; and that those
who wished to return home were at liberty to return and
carry back word to their relations that they were come
back, having deserted their king in the midst of his
enemies. Having said this, he retired into his tent, and
did not admit any of the Companions on that day, or
until the third day from that, waiting to see if any change
would occur in the minds of the Macedonians and Grecian
allies, as is wont to happen, as a general rule among a
crowd of soldiers, rendering them more disposed to obey.
But on the contrary, when there was a profound silence
throughout the camp, and the soldiers were evidently
annoyed at his wrath, without being at all changed by it,
Ptolemy, son of Lagus, says that he none the less offered
sacrifice there for the passage of the river, but the
victims were unfavourable to him when he sacrificed.
Then indeed he collected the oldest of the Companions
and especially those who were friendly to him, and as all
things indicated the advisability of returning, he made
known to the army that he had resolved to march back
again.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER XXIX.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Alexander Recrosses the Hydraotes and Acesines.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Then</span> they shouted as a mixed multitude would shout
when rejoicing; and most of them shed tears of joy.<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
Some of them even approached the royal tent, and prayed
for many blessings upon Alexander; because by them
alone he suffered himself to be conquered. Then he
divided the army into brigades, and ordered twelve altars
to be prepared, equal in height to very large towers, and
in breadth much larger than towers, to serve as thank-offerings
to the gods who had led him so far as a conqueror,
and also to serve as monuments of his own labours.<a name="FNanchor_723" id="FNanchor_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_723" class="fnanchor">723</a>
When the altars were completed, he offered sacrifice
upon them according to his custom, and celebrated
a gymnastic and equestrian contest. After adding the
country as far as the river Hyphasis to the dominion
of Porus, he marched back to the Hydraotes. Having
crossed this river, he continued his return march to the
Acesines, where he found the city which Hephaestion
had been ordered to fortify, quite built. In this city be
settled as many of the neighbouring people as volunteered
to live in it, as well as those of the Grecian mercenaries
who were now unfit for military service; and then began
to make the necessary preparations for a voyage down
the river into the Great Sea. At this time Arsaces, the
ruler of the land bordering on that of Abisares, and the
brother of the latter, with his other relations, came to
Alexander, bringing the gifts which are reckoned most
valuable among the Indians, including some elephants
from Abisares, thirty in number. They declared that Abisares
himself was unable to come on account of illness;
and with these men the ambassadors sent by Alexander
to Abisares agreed. Readily believing that such was
the case, he granted that prince the privilege of ruling
his own country as his viceroy, and placed Arsaces also
under his power. After arranging what tribute they were
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
to pay, he again offered sacrifice near the river Acesines.
He then crossed that river again, and came to the Hydaspes,
where he employed the army in repairing the damage
caused to the cities of Nicaea and Bucephala by the rain,
and put the other affairs of the country in order.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Preparations for a Voyage down the Indus.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Alexander</span> now resolved to sail down the Hydaspes to
the Great Sea, after he had prepared on the banks of
that river many thirty-oared galleys and others with one
and a half bank of oars, as well as a number of vessels
for conveying horses, and all the other things requisite
for the easy conveyance of an army on a river. At first
he thought he had discovered the origin of the Nile,
when he saw crocodiles in the river Indus, which he had
seen in no other river except the Nile,<a name="FNanchor_724" id="FNanchor_724"></a><a href="#Footnote_724" class="fnanchor">724</a> as well as beans
growing near the banks of the Acesines of the same kind
as those which the Egyptian land produces.<a name="FNanchor_725" id="FNanchor_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_725" class="fnanchor">725</a> This conjecture
was confirmed when he heard that the Acesines
falls into the Indus. He thought the Nile rises somewhere
or other in India, and after flowing through an
extensive tract of desert country loses the name of Indus
there; but afterwards when it begins to flow again
through the inhabited land, it is called Nile both by the
Aethiopians of that district and by the Egyptians, and
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>finally empties itself into the Inner Sea.<a name="FNanchor_726" id="FNanchor_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_726" class="fnanchor">726</a> In like manner
Homer made the river Egypt give its name to the
country of Egypt.<a name="FNanchor_727" id="FNanchor_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_727" class="fnanchor">727</a> Accordingly when he wrote to
Olympias about the country of India, after mentioning
other things, he said that he thought he had discovered
the sources of the Nile, forming his conclusions about
things so great from such small and trivial premisses.
However, when he had made a more careful inquiry into
the facts relating to the river Indus, he learned the following
details from the natives:&mdash;That the Hydaspes
unites its water with the Acesines, as the latter does
with the Indus, and that they both yield up their names
to the Indus; that the last-named river has two mouths,
through which it discharges itself into the Great Sea;
but that it has no connection with the Egyptian country.
He then removed from the letter to his mother the part
he had written about the Nile.<a name="FNanchor_728" id="FNanchor_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_728" class="fnanchor">728</a> Planning a voyage down
the rivers as far as the Great Sea, he ordered ships for
this purpose to be prepared for him. The crews of his
ships were fully supplied from the Phoenicians, Cyprians,
Carians, and Egyptians who accompanied the army.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Voyage down the Hydaspes.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">At</span> this time Coenus, who was one of Alexander’s most
faithful Companions, fell ill and died, and the king buried
him with as much magnificence as circumstances allowed.
Then collecting the Companions and the Indian envoys
who had come to him, he appointed Porus king of the
part of India which had already been conquered, seven
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>nations in all, containing more than 2,000 cities. After
this he made the following distribution of his army.<a name="FNanchor_729" id="FNanchor_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_729" class="fnanchor">729</a>
With himself he placed on board the ships all the shield-bearing
guards, the archers, the Agrianians, and the
body-guard of cavalry.<a name="FNanchor_730" id="FNanchor_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_730" class="fnanchor">730</a> Craterus led a part of the infantry
and cavalry along the right bank of the Hydaspes,
while along the other bank Hephaestion advanced at the
head of the most numerous and efficient part of the army,
including the elephants, which now numbered about 200.
These generals were ordered to march as quickly as
possible to the place where the palace of Sopeithes was
situated,<a name="FNanchor_731" id="FNanchor_731"></a><a href="#Footnote_731" class="fnanchor">731</a> and Philip, the viceroy of the country beyond
the Indus<a name="FNanchor_732" id="FNanchor_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_732" class="fnanchor">732</a> extending to Bactria, was ordered to follow
them with his forces after an interval of three days. He
sent the Nysaean cavalry back to Nysa.<a name="FNanchor_733" id="FNanchor_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_733" class="fnanchor">733</a> The whole of
the naval force was under the command of Nearchus;
but the pilot of Alexander’s ship was Onesicritus, who,
in the narrative which he composed of Alexander’s campaigns,
falsely asserted that he was admiral, while in
reality he was only a pilot.<a name="FNanchor_734" id="FNanchor_734"></a><a href="#Footnote_734" class="fnanchor">734</a> According to Ptolemy,
son of Lagus, whose statements I chiefly follow, the entire
number of the ships was about eighty thirty-oared
galleys; but the whole number of vessels, including the
horse transports and boats, and all the other river craft,
both those previously plying on the rivers and those
built at that time, fell not far short of 2,000.<a name="FNanchor_735" id="FNanchor_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_735" class="fnanchor">735</a></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Voyage down the Hydaspes</span> (<i>continued</i>).</p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">When</span> he had made all the necessary preparations the
army began to embark at the approach of the dawn;
while according to custom he offered sacrifice to the
gods and to the river Hydaspes, as the prophets directed.<a name="FNanchor_736" id="FNanchor_736"></a><a href="#Footnote_736" class="fnanchor">736</a>
When he had embarked he poured a libation into
the river from the prow of the ship out of a golden goblet,
invoking the Acesines as well as the Hydaspes, because
he had ascertained that it is the largest of all the
rivers which unite with the Hydaspes, and that their
confluence was not far off. He also invoked the Indus,
into which the Acesines flows after its junction with the
Hydaspes. Moreover he poured out libations to his forefather
Heracles, to Ammon,<a name="FNanchor_737" id="FNanchor_737"></a><a href="#Footnote_737" class="fnanchor">737</a> and the other gods to whom
he was in the habit of sacrificing, and then he ordered
the signal for starting seawards to be given with the
trumpet. As soon as the signal was given they commenced
the voyage in regular order; for directions had
been given at what distance apart it was necessary for
the baggage vessels to be arranged, as also for the vessels
conveying the horses and for the ships of war; so
that they might not fall foul of each other by sailing
down the channel at random. He did not allow even
the fast-sailing ships to get out of rank by outstripping
the rest. The noise of the rowing was never equalled
on any other occasion, inasmuch as it proceeded from so
many ships rowed at the same time; also the shouting
of the boatswains giving the time for beginning and
stopping the stroke of the oars, and the clamour of
the rowers, when keeping time all together with the
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>dashing of the oars, made a noise like a battle-cry. The
banks of the river also, being in many places higher
than the ships, and collecting the sound into a narrow
space, sent back to each other an echo which was very
much increased by its very compression. In some parts
too the groves of trees on each side of the river helped
to swell the sound, both from the solitude and the reverberation
of the noise. The horses which were visible on
the decks of the transports struck the barbarians who
saw them with such surprise that those of them who
were present at the starting of the fleet accompanied it
a long way from the place of embarkation. For horses
had never before been seen on board ships in the country
of India; and the natives did not call to mind that the
expedition of Dionysus into India was a naval one. The
shouting of the rowers and the noise of the rowing were
heard by the Indians who had already submitted to
Alexander, and these came running down to the river’s
bank and accompanied him singing their native songs.
For the Indians have been eminently fond of singing and
dancing since the time of Dionysus and those who under
his bacchic inspiration traversed the land of the Indians
with him.<a name="FNanchor_738" id="FNanchor_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_738" class="fnanchor">738</a></p>

<hr />

<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Voyage down the Hydaspes into the Acesines.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Sailing</span> thus, he stopped on the third day at the spot
where he had instructed Hephaestion and Craterus to
encamp on opposite banks of the river at the same place.
Here he remained two days, until Philip with the rest of
the army came up with him. He then sent this general
with the men he brought with him to the river Acesines,
with orders to march along the bank of that river. He
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>also sent Craterus and Hephaestion off again with instructions
how they were to conduct the march. But he
himself continued his voyage down the river Hydaspes,
the channel of which is nowhere less than twenty stades
broad. Mooring his vessels near the banks wherever he
could, he received some of the Indians dwelling near
into allegiance by their voluntary surrender, while he reduced
by force those who came into a trial of strength
with him. Then be sailed rapidly towards the country
of the Mallians and Oxydracians, having ascertained that
these tribes were the most numerous and the most warlike
of the Indians in that region; and having been informed
that they had put their wives and children for
safety into their strongest cities, with the resolution of
fighting a battle with him, be made the voyage with
the greater speed with the express design of attacking
them before they had arranged their plans, and while
there was still lack of preparation and a state of confusion
among them. Thence he made his second start,
and on the fifth day reached the junction of the Hydaspes
and Acesines. Where these rivers unite, one very
narrow river is formed out of the two; and on account of
its narrowness the current is swift. There are also prodigious
eddies in the whirling stream, and the water
rises in waves and plashes exceedingly, so that the noise
of the swell of waters is distinctly heard by people while
they are still far off. These things had previously been
reported to Alexander by the natives, and be had told
his soldiers; and yet, when his army approached the
junction of the rivers, the noise made by the stream produced
so great an impression upon them that the sailors
stopped rowing, not from any word of command, but
because the very boatswains who gave the time to the
rowers became silent from astonishment and stood aghast
at the noise.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Voyage down the Acesines.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">When</span> they came near the junction of the rivers, the
pilots passed on the order that the men should row
as hard as possible to get out of the narrows, so that
the ships might not fall into the eddies and be overturned
by them, but might by the vigorous rowing overcome
the whirlings of the water. Being of a round
form, the merchant vessels which happened to be whirled
round by the current received no damage from the
eddy, but the men who were on board were thrown
into disorder and fright. For being kept upright by
the force of the stream itself, these vessels settled again
into the onward course. But the ships of war, being
long, did not emerge so scatheless from the whirling
current, not being raised aloft in the same way as the
others upon the plashing swell of water. These ships
had two ranks of oars on each side, the lower oars being
only a little out of the water. These vessels getting
athwart in the eddies, their oars could not be raised aloft
in proper time and were consequently caught by the
water and came into collision with each other. Thus
many of the ships were damaged; two indeed fell foul
of each other and were destroyed, and many of those
sailing in them perished.<a name="FNanchor_739" id="FNanchor_739"></a><a href="#Footnote_739" class="fnanchor">739</a> But when the river widened
out, there the current was no longer so rapid, and the
eddies did not whirl round with so much violence.
Alexander therefore moored his fleet on the right bank,
where there was a protection from the force of the
stream and a roadstead for the ships. A certain promontory
also in the river jutted out conveniently for collecting
the wrecks. He preserved the lives of the men
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>who were still being conveyed upon them; and when he
had repaired the damaged ships, he ordered Nearchus to
sail down the river until he reached the confines of the
nation called Mallians. He himself made an inroad into
the territories of the barbarians who would not yield to
him, and after preventing them from succouring the
Mallians, he again formed a junction with the naval
armament.<a name="FNanchor_740" id="FNanchor_740"></a><a href="#Footnote_740" class="fnanchor">740</a> Hephaestion, Craterus, and Philip had already
united their forces here. Alexander then transported
the elephants, the brigade of Polysperchon, the
horse-archers, and Philip with his army, across the river
Hydaspes, and instructed Craterus to lead them. He
sent Nearchus with the fleet with orders to set sail three
days before the army started. He divided the rest of
his army into three parts, and ordered Hephaestion to
go five days in advance, so that if any should flee before
the men under his own command and go rapidly forward
they might fall in with Hephaestion’s brigade and thus
be captured. He also gave a part of the army to Ptolemy,
son of Lagus, with orders to follow him after the
lapse of three days, so that all those who fled from him
and turned back again might fall in with Ptolemy’s
brigade. He ordered those in advance to wait, when
they arrived at the confluence of the rivers Acesines and
Hydraotes, until he himself came up; and he instructed
Craterus and Ptolemy also to form a junction with him
at the same place.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Campaign against the Mallians.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">He</span> then took the shield-bearing guards, the bowmen,
the Agrianians, Peithon’s brigade of men, who were
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>called foot Companions, all the horse bowmen and half
the cavalry Companions, and marched through a tract
of country destitute of water against the Mallians, a
tribe of the independent Indians.<a name="FNanchor_741" id="FNanchor_741"></a><a href="#Footnote_741" class="fnanchor">741</a> On the first day he
encamped near a small piece of water which was about
100 stades distant from the river Acesines. Having
dined there and caused his army to rest a short time,
he ordered every man to fill whatever vessel he had with
water. After travelling the remaining part of that day
and all the ensuing night a distance of about 400 stades,
he at daybreak reached the city into which many of the
Mallians had fled for refuge. Most of them were outside
the city and unarmed, supposing that Alexander would
never come against them through the waterless country.
It was evident that he led his army by this route for
this very reason, because it was difficult to lead an army
this way, and consequently it appeared incredible to the
enemy that he would lead his forces in this direction.
He therefore fell upon them unexpectedly, and killed
most of them without their even turning to defend themselves,
since they were unarmed. He cooped the rest up
in the city, and posted his cavalry all round the wall,
because the phalanx of infantry had not yet<a name="FNanchor_742" id="FNanchor_742"></a><a href="#Footnote_742" class="fnanchor">742</a> come up
with him. He thus made use of his cavalry in place of
a stockade. As soon as the infantry arrived, he sent
Perdiccas with his own cavalry regiment and that of
Clitus, as well as the Agrianians, against another city of
the Mallians, whither many of the Indians of that region
had fled for refuge. He ordered Perdiccas to blockade
the men in the city, but not to commence the action
until he himself should arrive, so that none might escape
from this city and carry news to the rest of the bar<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>barians
that Alexander was already approaching. He
then began to assault the wall; but the barbarians
abandoned it, finding that they were no longer able to
defend it, since many had been killed in the capture,
and others had been rendered unfit for fighting on account
of their wounds. Fleeing for refuge into the
citadel, they defended themselves for some time from a
position commanding from its height and difficult of
access. But as the Macedonians pressed on vigorously
from all sides, and Alexander himself appeared now in
this part of the action and now in that, the citadel was
taken by storm, and all the men who had fled into it
for refuge were killed, to the number of 2,000. Perdiccas
also reached the city to which he had been despatched
and found it deserted; but learning that the
inhabitants had fled from it not long before, he made a
forced march on the track of the fugitives. The light-armed
troops followed him as quickly as they could on
foot, so that he took and massacred as many of the fugitives
as could not outstrip him and flee for safety into
the river-marshes.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER VII.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Campaign against the Mallians</span> (<i>continued</i>).</p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">After</span> dining and causing his men to rest until the first
watch of the night, Alexander marched forward; and
travelling a great distance through the night, he arrived
at the river Hydraotes<a name="FNanchor_743" id="FNanchor_743"></a><a href="#Footnote_743" class="fnanchor">743</a> at daybreak. There he ascertained
that most of the Mallians had already crossed the
river; but coming upon those who were still in the act of
crossing, he slew many of them in their passage. Having
crossed with them in pursuit without any delay by the
same ford, he kept close up with those who had out<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>stripped
him in their retreat. Many also of these he
slew; some he took prisoners; but the majority of them
escaped into a place strong by nature and made more so by
fortifications. When the infantry reached him, Alexander
despatched Peithon against the men in the fortress, giving
him the command of his own brigade of infantry and two
regiments of cavalry. These, attacking the place, took it
at the first assault, and made slaves of all those who had
fled thither for safety, at least as many of them as had not
perished in the attack. After accomplishing this, Peithon
returned again to the camp. Alexander in person led his
forces against a certain city of the Brachmans,<a name="FNanchor_744" id="FNanchor_744"></a><a href="#Footnote_744" class="fnanchor">744</a> because
he ascertained that some of the Mallians had fled for
refuge into it. When he reached it, he led his phalanx
in serried ranks close up to the wall on all sides. The
enemy seeing that their walls were being undermined,
and being themselves repulsed by the missiles, abandoned
the walls, and having fled for safety into the citadel, began
to defend themselves from thence. A few Macedonians
having rushed in with them, turning round and drawing
together into a close body, drove some of them back
and killed five-and-twenty of them in their retreat. Hereupon
Alexander ordered the scaling-ladders to be placed
against the citadel on all sides, and the wall to be undermined;
and when one of the towers, being undermined,
fell down, and a part of the wall between two towers was
breached, and thus rendered the citadel more accessible
to assault in this quarter, he was seen to be the first man
to scale the wall and get hold of it. The other Macedonians
seeing him were ashamed of themselves and mounted
the ladders in various places. The citadel was soon in
their possession. Some of the Indians began to set fire to
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>the houses, and being caught in them were killed; but
most of them were slain fighting. About 5,000 in all
were killed; and on account of their valour, only a few
were taken prisoners.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Defeat of the Mallians at the River Hydraotes.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Having</span> remained there one day to give his army rest, he
advanced on the morrow against the other Mallians. He
found the cities abandoned, and ascertained that the men
had fled into the desert. There he again gave the army
one day’s rest, and on the next day sent Peithon and
Demetrius the cavalry general back to the river, in command
of their own troops, giving them in addition as many
battalions of the light-armed infantry as were sufficient
for the enterprise. Their instructions were to go along
the bank of the river, and if they met any of those
who had fled for safety into the woods, of which there
were many near the river’s bank, to kill all who refused
to surrender. Peithon and Demetrius captured many
of these in the woods and killed them. He himself
led his forces against the largest city of the Mallians,
whither he was informed many from the other cities had
taken refuge. But this also the Indians abandoned when
they heard that Alexander was marching against it.
Crossing the river Hydraotes, they remained with their
forces drawn up upon its bank, because it was high, and
they thought they could obstruct Alexander’s passage.
When he heard this, he took all the cavalry which he had
with him, and went to the part of the river where he was
informed that the Mallians had drawn themselves up for
battle; and the infantry was ordered to follow. When he
reached the river and beheld the enemy drawn up on the
opposite bank, he made no delay, but instantly plunged
into the ford with the cavalry alone. When they saw<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
that he was now in the middle of the river, though they
were drawn up ready for battle, they withdrew from the
bank with all speed; and Alexander followed them with
his cavalry alone. But when the Indians perceived only
cavalry, they wheeled round and fought with desperate
valour, being about 50,000 in number. When Alexander
perceived that their phalanx was densely compact, and
that his own infantry was absent, he rode right round
their army and made charges upon them, but did not
come to close fighting with them. Meanwhile the archers,
the Agrianians and the other battalions of light-armed
infantry, being picked men whom he was leading with
him, arrived, and his phalanx of infantry was seen not far
off. As all kinds of danger were threatening them at
once, the Indians now wheeled round again and began
to flee with headlong speed into the strongest of their
adjacent cities; but Alexander followed them and slew
many, while those who escaped into the city were cooped
up within it. At first indeed he surrounded the city with
the horse-soldiers as they came up from the march; but
when the infantry arrived, he encamped all round the wall
for this day, because not much of it was left for making
the assault, and his army had been exhausted, the infantry
by the long march, and the cavalry by the uninterrupted
pursuit, and especially by the passage of the river.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER IX.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Storming of the Mallian Stronghold.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">On</span> the following day, dividing the army into two parts,
he himself assaulted the wall at the head of one, and
Perdiccas led on the other. Upon this the Indians did
not wait to receive the attack of the Macedonians, but
abandoned the walls of the city and fled for safety into
the citadel. Alexander and his troops therefore split
open a small gate, and got within the city long before the<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
others; for those who had been put under Perdiccas were
behind time, having experienced difficulty in scaling the
walls, as most of them did not bring ladders, thinking
that the city had been captured, when they observed that
the walls were deserted by the defenders. But when the
citadel was seen to be still in the possession of the enemy,
and many of them were observed drawn up in front of it
to repel attacks, some of the Macedonians tried to force
an entry by undermining the wall, and others by placing
scaling ladders against it, wherever it was practicable to
do so. Alexander, thinking that the men who carried the
ladders were too slow, snatched one from a man who was
carrying it, placed it against the wall, and began to mount
it, crouching under his shield. After him mounted Peucestas,
the man who carried the sacred shield which
Alexander took from the temple of the Trojan Athena and
used to keep with him, and have it carried before him
in all his battles.<a name="FNanchor_745" id="FNanchor_745"></a><a href="#Footnote_745" class="fnanchor">745</a> After Peucestas, by the same ladder
ascended Leonnatus the confidential body-guard; and up
another ladder went Abreas, one of the soldiers who
received double pay for distinguished services.<a name="FNanchor_746" id="FNanchor_746"></a><a href="#Footnote_746" class="fnanchor">746</a> The king
was now near the battlement of the wall, and leaning his
shield against it was pushing some of the Indians within
the fort, and had cleared that part of the wall, by killing
others with his sword. The shield-bearing guards becoming
very anxious for the king’s safety, pushed each other
with ardour up the same ladder and broke it; so that
those who were already mounting fell down and made the
ascent impracticable for the rest. Alexander then, standing
upon the wall, was being assailed all round from the
adjacent towers; for none of the Indians dared approach
him. He was also being assailed by the men in the city,
who were throwing darts at him from no great distance;
for a mound of earth happened to have been heaped up
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>there opposite the wall. Alexander was conspicuous both
by the brightness of his weapons and by his extraordinary
display of audacity. He therefore perceived that if he
remained where he was, he would be incurring danger
without being able to perform anything at all worthy of
consideration; but if he leaped down within the fort he
might perhaps by this very act strike the Indians with
terror, and if he did not, but should only thereby be incurring
danger, at any rate he would die not ignobly after
performing great deeds of valour worthy of recollection by
men of after times.<a name="FNanchor_747" id="FNanchor_747"></a><a href="#Footnote_747" class="fnanchor">747</a> Forming this resolution, he leaped
down from the wall into the citadel; where, supporting
himself against the wall, he struck with his sword and
killed some of the Indians who came to close quarters
with him, including their leader, who rushed upon him too
boldly. Another man who approached him he kept in
check by hurling a stone at him, and a third in like manner.
Those who advanced nearer to him he again kept
off with his sword; so that the barbarians were no longer
willing to approach him, but standing round him cast at
him from all sides whatever any one happened to have
or could get hold of at the time.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER X.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Alexander Dangerously Wounded.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Meantime</span> Peucestas and Abreas, the soldier entitled to
double pay, and after them Leonnatus, being the only
men who happened to have scaled the wall before the
ladders were broken, had leaped down and were fighting
in front of the king. Abreas, the man entitled to double
pay, fell there, being shot with an arrow in the forehead.
Alexander himself also was wounded with an arrow under
the breast through his breastplate into the chest, so that
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>Ptolemy says air was breathed out from the wound together
with the blood. But although he was faint with
exhaustion, he defended himself, as long as his blood
was still warm. But the blood streaming out copiously
and without ceasing at every expiration of breath, he was
seized with a dizziness and swooning, and bending over
fell upon his shield. After he had fallen Peucestas defended
him, holding over him in front the sacred shield
brought from Troy; and on the other side he was
defended by Leonnatus. But both these men were
themselves wounded, and Alexander was now nearly
fainting away from loss of blood. For the Macedonians
had experienced great difficulty in the assault also on this
account, because those who saw Alexander being shot at
upon the wall and then leaping down into the citadel
within, in their ardour arising from fear lest their king
should meet with any mishap by recklessly exposing himself
to danger, broke the ladders. Then some began to
devise one plan and others another to mount upon the
wall, as well as they could in their state of embarrassment,
some fixing pegs into the wall, which was made of earth,
and suspending themselves from these hoisted themselves
up with difficulty by their means; others got up by mounting
one upon the other. The first man who got up threw
himself down from the wall into the city, and so on in
succession; and when they saw the king lying there on
the ground they all raised a loud lamentation and howl of
grief. Now ensued a desperate conflict around his fallen
body, one Macedonian after another holding his shield
in front of him. In the meantime some of the soldiers
having shivered in pieces the bar by which the gate
in the space of wall between the towers was secured,
entered the city a few at the time; while others, inasmuch
as a gap had been made in the gate, put their shoulders
under it and forced it into the space inside the wall, and
thus laid the citadel open in that quarter.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XI.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Alexander Wounded.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Hereupon</span> some of them began to kill the Indians, all
of whom they slew, sparing not even a woman or child.
Others carried off the king, who was lying in a faint
condition, upon his shield; and they could not yet tell
whether he was likely to survive. Some authors have
stated that Critodemus, a physician of Cos, an Asclepiad
by birth,<a name="FNanchor_748" id="FNanchor_748"></a><a href="#Footnote_748" class="fnanchor">748</a> made an incision into the injured part and
drew the weapon out of the wound. Other authors say
that as there was no physician present at the critical
moment, Perdiccas, the confidential body-guard, at Alexander’s
bidding, made an incision with his sword into the
wounded part and removed the weapon. On its removal
there was such a copious effusion of blood that Alexander
swooned again; and the effect of the swoon was, that the
effusion of blood was stanched.<a name="FNanchor_749" id="FNanchor_749"></a><a href="#Footnote_749" class="fnanchor">749</a> Many other things concerning
this catastrophe have been recorded by the
historians; and Rumour having received the statements
as they were given by the first falsifiers of the facts,
still preserves them even to our times, nor will she desist
from handing the falsehoods on to others also in regular
succession, unless a stop is put to it by this history.<a name="FNanchor_750" id="FNanchor_750"></a><a href="#Footnote_750" class="fnanchor">750</a>
For example, the common account is, that this calamity
befell Alexander among the Oxydracians; whereas, it
really occurred among the Mallians, an independent tribe
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>of Indians; the city belonged to the Mallians,<a name="FNanchor_751" id="FNanchor_751"></a><a href="#Footnote_751" class="fnanchor">751</a> and the
men who wounded him were Mallians. These people,
indeed, had resolved to join their forces with the Oxydracians
and then to make a desperate struggle; but
he forestalled them by marching against them through
the waterless country, before any aid could reach them
from the Oxydracians, or they could render any help
to the latter. Moreover, the common account is, that
the last battle fought with Darius was near Arbela, at
which battle he fled and did not desist from flight until
he was arrested by Bessus and put to death at Alexander’s
approach; just as the battle before this was at
Issus, and the first cavalry battle near the Granicus.
The cavalry battle did really take place near the
Granicus, and the next battle with Darius near Issus;
but those authors who make Arbela most distant say
that it is 600<a name="FNanchor_752" id="FNanchor_752"></a><a href="#Footnote_752" class="fnanchor">752</a> stades distant from the place where the
last battle between Alexander and Darius was fought,
while those who make it least distant, say that it is 500
stades off. Moreover, Ptolemy and Aristobulus say that
the battle was fought at Gaugamela near the river
Bumodus. But as Gaugamela was not a city, but only a
large village, the place is not celebrated, nor is the name
pleasing to the ear; hence, it seems to me, that Arbela,
being a city, has carried off the glory of the great battle.
But if it is necessary to consider that this engagement
took place near Arbela, being in reality so far distant
from it, then it is allowable to say that the sea-battle
fought at Salamis occurred near the isthmus<a name="FNanchor_753" id="FNanchor_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_753" class="fnanchor">753</a> of the
Corinthians, and that fought at Artemisium, in Euboea,
occurred near Aegina or Sunium. Moreover, in regard
to those who covered Alexander with their shields in his
peril, all agree that Peucestas did so; but they no longer
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>agree in regard to Leonnatus or Abreas, the soldier
in receipt of double pay for his distinguished services.
Some say that Alexander, having received a blow on the
head with a piece of wood, fell down in a fit of dizziness;
and that having risen again he was wounded with a dart
through the corselet in the chest. But Ptolemy, son of
Lagus, says that he received only this wound in the chest.
However, in my opinion, the greatest error made by those
who have written the history of Alexander is the following.
There are some who have recorded<a name="FNanchor_754" id="FNanchor_754"></a><a href="#Footnote_754" class="fnanchor">754</a> that Ptolemy,
son of Lagus, in company with Peucestas, mounted the
ladder with Alexander; that Ptolemy held his shield over
him when he lay wounded, and that he was called Soter
(the preserver) on that account.<a name="FNanchor_755" id="FNanchor_755"></a><a href="#Footnote_755" class="fnanchor">755</a> And yet Ptolemy himself
has recorded that he was not even present at this
engagement, but was fighting battles against other barbarians
at the head of another army. Let me mention
these facts as a digression from the main narrative, so
that the correct account of such great deeds and calamities
may not be a matter of indifference to men of the
future.<a name="FNanchor_756" id="FNanchor_756"></a><a href="#Footnote_756" class="fnanchor">756</a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XII.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Anxiety of the Soldiers about Alexander.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">While</span> Alexander was remaining in this place until his
wound was cured, the first news which reached the camp
from which he had set out to attack the Mallians was
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>that he had died of the wound; and at first there arose
a sound of lamentation from the entire army, as one man
handed the rumour on to another. When they ceased
their lamentation, they became spiritless, and felt perplexed
as to the man who was to become the leader of the
army; for many of the officers seemed to have stood in
equal rank and merit, both in the opinion of Alexander
and in that of the Macedonians. They were also in a
state of perplexity how to get back in safety to their
own country, being quite enclosed by so many warlike
nations, some of whom had not yet submitted, and who
they conjectured would fight stoutly for their freedom;
while others would no doubt revolt as soon as they
were relieved of their fear of Alexander. Besides, they
seemed at that time to be in the midst of impassable
rivers, and all things appeared to them uncertain and
impracticable now that they were bereft of Alexander.
But when at length the news came that he was still alive,
they with difficulty acquiesced in it; and did not yet
believe that he was likely to survive. Even when a
letter came from the king, saying that he was coming
down to the camp in a short time, this did not appear
to most of them worthy of credit, on account of their
excessive fear; for they conjectured that the letter was
concocted by his confidential body-guards and generals.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER XIII.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Joy of the Soldiers at Alexander’s Recovery.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">When</span> Alexander became acquainted with this, for fear
some attempt at a revolution might be made in the army,
he had himself conveyed, as soon as it could be done
with safety, to the bank of the river Hydraotes, and
placed in a boat to sail down the river. For the camp
was at the confluence of the Hydraotes and Acesines,<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
where Hephaestion was at the head of the army, and
Nearchus of the fleet. When the ship bearing the king
approached the camp, he ordered the tent covering to be
removed from the stern, that he might be visible to all.
But they were still incredulous, thinking, forsooth, that
Alexander’s corpse was being conveyed on the vessel;
until at length he stretched out his hand to the multitude,
when the ship was nearing the bank. Then the
men raised a cheer, lifting their hands, some towards
the sky and others to the king himself. Many even
shed involuntary tears at the unexpected sight. Some
of the shield-bearing guards brought a litter for him
when he was conveyed out of the ship; but he ordered
them to fetch his horse. When he was seen again
mounting his horse, the whole army re-echoed with loud
clapping of hands, so that the banks of the river and
the groves near them reverberated with the sound. On
approaching his tent he dismounted from his horse, so
that he might be seen walking. Then the men came
near, some on one side, others on the other, some touching
his hands, others his knees, others only his clothes.
Some only came close to get a sight of him, and went
away having chanted his praise, while others threw
garlands upon him, or the flowers which the country of
India supplied at that season of the year. Nearchus
says that some of his friends incurred his displeasure,
reproaching him for exposing himself to danger in the
front of the army in battle; which they said was the duty
of a private soldier, and not that of the general.<a name="FNanchor_757" id="FNanchor_757"></a><a href="#Footnote_757" class="fnanchor">757</a> It
seems to me that Alexander was offended at these remarks,
because be knew that they were correct, and that
he deserved the censure. However, like those who are
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>mastered by any other pleasure, he had not sufficient
self-control to keep aloof from danger, through his impetuosity
in battle and his passion for glory. Nearchus
also says that a certain old Boeotian, whose name he
does not mention, perceiving that Alexander was offended
at the censures of his friends and was looking
sullenly at them, came near him, and speaking in the
Boeotian dialect, said: “O Alexander, it is the part of
heroes to perform great deeds!” and repeated a certain
Iambic verse, the purport of which is, that the man who
performs anything great is destined also to suffer.<a name="FNanchor_758" id="FNanchor_758"></a><a href="#Footnote_758" class="fnanchor">758</a> This
man was not only acceptable to Alexander at the time,
but was afterwards received into his more intimate
acquaintance.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER XIV.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Voyage down the Hydraotes and Acesines into the
Indus.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">At</span> this time arrived envoys from the Mallians who still
survived, offering the submission of the nation; also from
the Oxydracians came both the leaders of the cities and
the governors of the provinces, accompanied by the other
150 most notable men, with full powers to make a
treaty, bringing the gifts which are considered most
valuable among the Indians, and also, like the Mallians,
offering the submission of their nation. They said
that their error in not having sent an embassy to
him before was pardonable, because they excelled other
races in the desire to be free and independent, and
their freedom had been secure from the time Dionysus
came into India until Alexander came; but if it seemed
good to him, inasmuch as there was a general report that
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>he also was sprung from gods, they were willing to receive
whatever viceroy he might appoint, pay the tribute
decreed by him, and give him as many hostages as he
might demand. He therefore demanded the thousand
best men of the nation, whom he might hold as hostages,
if he pleased; and if not, that he might keep them as
soldiers in his army, until he had finished the war which
he was waging against the other Indians. They accordingly
selected the thousand best and tallest men
of their number, and sent them to him, together with
500 chariots and charioteers, though these were not
demanded. Alexander appointed Philip viceroy over
these people and the Mallians who were still surviving.
He sent back the hostages to them, but retained the
chariots. When he had satisfactorily arranged these
matters, since many vessels had been built during the
delay arising from his being wounded,<a name="FNanchor_759" id="FNanchor_759"></a><a href="#Footnote_759" class="fnanchor">759</a> he embarked
1,700 of the cavalry Companions, as many of the light-armed
troops as before, and 10,000 infantry, and sailed
a short distance down the river Hydraotes. But when
that river mingled its waters with the Acesines, the
latter giving its name to the united stream, he continued
his voyage down the Acesines, until he reached its junction
with the Indus. For these four large rivers,<a name="FNanchor_760" id="FNanchor_760"></a><a href="#Footnote_760" class="fnanchor">760</a> which
are all navigable, discharge their water into the river
Indus, though each does not retain its distinct name.
For the Hydaspes discharges itself into the Acesines,
and after the junction the whole stream forms what is
called the Acesines. Again this same river unites with
the Hydraotes, and after absorbing this river, still retains
its own name. After this the Acesines takes in the
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>Hyphasis, and finally flows into the Indus under its own
name; but after the junction it yields its name to the
Indus. From this point I have no doubt that the Indus
proceeds 100 stades,<a name="FNanchor_761" id="FNanchor_761"></a><a href="#Footnote_761" class="fnanchor">761</a> and perhaps more, before it is
divided so as to form the Delta; and there it spreads
out more like a lake than a river.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER XV.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Voyage down the Indus to the Land of Musicanus.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">There</span>, at the confluence of the Acesines and Indus, he
waited until Perdiccas with the army arrived, after having
routed on his way the independent tribe of the Abastanians.<a name="FNanchor_762" id="FNanchor_762"></a><a href="#Footnote_762" class="fnanchor">762</a>
Meantime, he was joined by other thirty-oared
galleys and trading vessels which had been built
for him among the Xathrians, another independent tribe
of Indians who had yielded to him. From the Ossadians,
who were also an independent tribe of Indians, came
envoys to offer the submission of their nation. Having
fixed the confluence of the Acesines and Indus as the
limit of Philip’s viceroyalty, he left with him all the
Thracians and as many men from the infantry regiments
as appeared to him sufficient to provide for the security
of the country. He then ordered a city to be founded
there at the very junction of the two rivers, expecting
that it would become large and famous among men.<a name="FNanchor_763" id="FNanchor_763"></a><a href="#Footnote_763" class="fnanchor">763</a> He
also ordered a dockyard to be made there. At this time
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>the Bactrian Oxyartes, father of his wife Roxana, came
to him, to whom he gave the viceroyalty over the Parapamisadians,
after dismissing the former viceroy, Tiryaspes,
because he was reported to be exercising his
authority improperly.<a name="FNanchor_764" id="FNanchor_764"></a><a href="#Footnote_764" class="fnanchor">764</a> Then he transported Craterus
with the main body of the army and the elephants to
the left bank of the river Indus, both because it seemed
easier for a heavy-armed force to march along that side
of the river, and the tribes dwelling near were not
quite friendly. He himself sailed down to the capital
of the Sogdians; where he fortified another city, made
another dockyard, and repaired his shattered vessels.
He appointed Oxyartes viceroy, and Peithon general of
the land extending from the confluence of the Indus and
Acesines as far as the sea, together with all the coastland
of India. He then again despatched Craterus with
his army through the country of the Arachotians and
Drangians; and himself sailed down the river into the
dominions of Musicanus, which was reported to be the
most prosperous part of India. He advanced against
this king because he had not yet come to meet him to
offer the submission of himself and his land, nor had
he sent envoys to seek his alliance. He had not even
sent him the gifts which were suitable for a great king,
or asked any favour from him. He accelerated his
voyage down the river to such a degree that he succeeded
in reaching the confines of the land of Musicanus
before he had even heard that Alexander had started
against him. Musicanus was so greatly alarmed that
he went as fast as he could to meet him, bringing with
him the gifts valued most highly among the Indians,
and taking all his elephants. He offered to surrender
both his nation and himself, at the same time acknow<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>ledging
his error, which was the most effectual way with
Alexander for any one to get what he requested. Accordingly
for these considerations Alexander granted him
an indemnity for his offences. He also granted him the
privilege of ruling the city and country, both of which
Alexander admired. Craterus was directed to fortify the
citadel in the capital; which was done while Alexander
was still present. A garrison was also placed in it,
because he thought the place suitable for keeping the
circumjacent tribes in subjection.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER XVI.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Campaign against Oxycanus and Sambus.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Then</span> he took the archers, Agrianians, and cavalry sailing
with him, and marched against the governor of that
country, whose name was Oxycanus,<a name="FNanchor_765" id="FNanchor_765"></a><a href="#Footnote_765" class="fnanchor">765</a> because he neither
came himself nor did envoys come from him, to offer the
surrender of himself and his land. At the very first
assault he took by storm the two largest cities under the
rule of Oxycanus; in the second of which that prince himself
was captured. The booty he gave to his army, but
the elephants he led with himself. The other cities in the
same land surrendered to him as he advanced, nor did
any one turn to resist him; so cowed in spirit<a name="FNanchor_766" id="FNanchor_766"></a><a href="#Footnote_766" class="fnanchor">766</a> had all the
Indians now become at the thought of Alexander and his
fortune. He then marched back against Sambus, whom
he had appointed viceroy of the mountaineer Indians and
who was reported to have fled, because he learned that Musicanus
had been pardoned by Alexander and was ruling
over his own land. For he was at war with Musicanus.
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>But when Alexander approached the city which the country
of Sambus held as its metropolis, the name of which
was Sindimana, the gates were thrown open to him at his
approach, and the relations of Sambus reckoned up his
money and went out to meet him, taking with them the
elephants also. They assured him that Sambus had fled,
not from any hostile feeling towards Alexander, but fearing
on account of the pardon of Musicanus.<a name="FNanchor_767" id="FNanchor_767"></a><a href="#Footnote_767" class="fnanchor">767</a> He also captured
another city which had revolted at this time, and slew as
many of the Brachmans<a name="FNanchor_768" id="FNanchor_768"></a><a href="#Footnote_768" class="fnanchor">768</a> as had been instigators of this
revolt. These men are the philosophers of the Indians,
of whose philosophy, if such it may be called, I shall give
an account in my book descriptive of India.<a name="FNanchor_769" id="FNanchor_769"></a><a href="#Footnote_769" class="fnanchor">769</a></p>

<hr />

<h3>CHAPTER XVII.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Musicanus Executed.&mdash;Capture of Patala.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Meantime</span> he was informed that Musicanus had revolted.
He despatched the viceroy, Peithon, son of Agenor, with
a sufficient army against him, while he himself marched
against the cities which had been put under the rule of
Musicanus. Some of these he razed to the ground,
reducing the inhabitants to slavery; and into others he
introduced garrisons and fortified the citadels. After
accomplishing this, be returned to the camp and fleet.
By this time Musicanus had been captured by Peithon,
who was bringing him to Alexander. The king ordered
him to be hanged in his own country, and with him as
many of the Brachmans as had instigated him to the revolt.
Then came to him the ruler of the land of the Patalians,<a name="FNanchor_770" id="FNanchor_770"></a><a href="#Footnote_770" class="fnanchor">770</a>
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>who said that the Delta formed by the river Indus was
still larger than the Egyptian Delta.<a name="FNanchor_771" id="FNanchor_771"></a><a href="#Footnote_771" class="fnanchor">771</a> This man surrendered
to him the whole of his own land and entrusted
both himself and his property to him. Alexander sent
him away again in possession of his own dominions, with
instructions to provide whatever was needful for the
reception of the army. He then sent Craterus into
Carmania with the brigades of Attalus, Meleager, and
Antigenes, some of the archers, and as many of the Companions
and other Macedonians as, being now unfit for
military service, he was despatching to Macedonia by the
route through the lands of the Arachotians and Zarangians.
To Craterus he also gave the duty of leading the elephants;
but the rest of the army, except the part of it
which was sailing with himself down to the sea, he put
under the command of Hephaestion. He transported
Peithon with the cavalry-lancers and Agrianians to the
opposite bank of the Indus, not the one along which
Hephaestion was about to lead the army. Peithon was
ordered to collect men to colonize the cities which had
just been fortified, and to form a junction with the king
at Patala, after having settled the affairs of the Indians
of that region, if they attempted any revolutionary proceedings.
On the third day of his voyage, Alexander
was informed that the governor of the Patalians<a name="FNanchor_772" id="FNanchor_772"></a><a href="#Footnote_772" class="fnanchor">772</a> had
collected most of his subjects and was going away by
stealth, having left his land deserted. For this reason
Alexander sailed down the river with greater speed than
before<a name="FNanchor_773" id="FNanchor_773"></a><a href="#Footnote_773" class="fnanchor">773</a>; and when he arrived at Patala, he found both
the country and the city deserted by the inhabitants
and tillers of the soil. He however despatched the light<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>est
troops in his army in pursuit of the fugitives; and
when some of them were captured, he sent them away
to the rest, bidding them be of good courage and return,
for they might inhabit the city and till the country as
before. Most of them accordingly returned.</p>

Patala, he sent men into the adjacent country, which was
waterless, to dig wells and to render the land fit for
habitation. Certain of the native barbarians attacked
these men, and falling upon them unawares slew some of
them; but having lost many of their own men, they fled
into the desert. The work was therefore accomplished by
those who had been sent out, another army having joined
them, which Alexander had despatched to take part in
the work, when he heard of the attack of the barbarians.
Near Patala the water of the Indus is divided into two
large rivers, both of which retain the name of Indus as
far as the sea. Here Alexander constructed a harbour
and dockyard; and when his works had advanced towards
completion he resolved to sail down as far as the mouth
of the right branch of the river.<a name="FNanchor_774" id="FNanchor_774"></a><a href="#Footnote_774" class="fnanchor">774</a> He gave Leonnatus
the command of 1,000 cavalry and 8,000 heavy and light-armed
infantry, and sent him to march through the
island of Patala opposite the naval expedition; while he
himself took the fastest sailing vessels, having one and a
half bank of oars, all the thirty-oared galleys, and some of
the boats, and began to sail down the right branch of the
river. The Indians of that region had fled, and conse<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>quently
he could get no pilot for the voyage, and the
navigation of the river was very difficult. On the day
after the start a storm arose, and the wind blowing right
against the stream made the river hollow<a name="FNanchor_775" id="FNanchor_775"></a><a href="#Footnote_775" class="fnanchor">775</a> and shattered
the hulls of the vessels violently, so that most of his
ships were injured, and some of the thirty-oared galleys
were entirely broken up. But they succeeded in running
them aground before they quite fell to pieces in the
water; and others were therefore constructed. He then
sent the quickest of the light-armed troops into the land
beyond the river’s bank and captured some Indians, who
from this time piloted him down the channel. But when
they arrived at the place where the river expands, so
that where it was widest it extended 200 stades, a strong
wind blew from the outer sea, and the oars could hardly
be raised in the swell; they therefore took refuge again
in a canal into which his pilots conducted them.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIX.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Voyage down the Indus into the Sea.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">While</span> their vessels were moored here, the phenomenon
of the ebb and flow of the tide in the great sea occurred,
so that their ships were left upon dry ground. This
caused Alexander and his companions no small alarm,
inasmuch as they were previously quite unacquainted with
it. But they were much more alarmed when, the time
coming round again, the water approached and the hulls of
the vessels were raised aloft.<a name="FNanchor_776" id="FNanchor_776"></a><a href="#Footnote_776" class="fnanchor">776</a> The ships which it caught
settled in the mud were raised aloft without any damage,
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>and floated again without receiving any injury; but those
that had been left on the drier land and had not a firm
settlement, when an immense compact wave advanced,
either fell foul of each other or were dashed against the
land and thus shattered to pieces. When Alexander had
repaired these vessels as well as his circumstances permitted,
he sent some men on in advance down the river
in two boats to explore the island at which the natives
said he must moor his vessels in his voyage to the sea.
They told him that the name of the island was Cilluta.<a name="FNanchor_777" id="FNanchor_777"></a><a href="#Footnote_777" class="fnanchor">777</a>
As he was informed that there were harbours in this
island, that it was a large one and had plenty of water in
it, he made the rest of his fleet put in there; but he himself
with the best sailing ships advanced beyond, to see
if the mouth of the river afforded an easy voyage out into
the open sea. After advancing about 200 stades from
the first island, they descried another which was quite
out in the sea. Then indeed they returned to the island
in the river; and having moored his vessels near the extremity
of it, Alexander offered sacrifice to those gods to
whom he said he had been directed by Ammon to sacrifice.
On the following day he sailed down to the other island
which was in the deep sea; and having come to shore
here also, he offered other sacrifices to other gods and in
another manner. These sacrifices he also offered according
to the oracular instructions of Ammon. Then having
gone beyond the mouths of the river Indus, he sailed out
into the open sea, as he said, to discover if any land lay
anywhere near in the sea; but in my opinion, chiefly that
he might be able to say that he had navigated the great
outer sea of India. There he sacrificed some bulls to
Poseidon and cast them into the sea; and having poured
out a libation after the sacrifice, he threw the goblet and
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>bowls, which were golden, into the deep as thank-offerings,
praying the god to escort safely for him the fleet, which
he intended to despatch to the Persian Gulf and the
mouths of the Euphrates and Tigres.<a name="FNanchor_778" id="FNanchor_778"></a><a href="#Footnote_778" class="fnanchor">778</a></p>

<hr />

<h3>CHAPTER XX.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Exploration of the Mouths of the Indus.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Returning</span> to Patala, he found that the citadel had been
fortified and that Peithon had arrived with his army,
having accomplished everything for which he was despatched.
He ordered Hephaestion to prepare what was
needful for the fortification of a naval station and the
construction of dockyards; for he resolved to leave
behind here a fleet of many ships near the city of Patala,
where the river Indus divides itself into two streams. He
himself sailed down again into the Great Sea by the other
mouth of the Indus, to ascertain which branch of the
river is easier to navigate. The mouths of the river Indus
are about 1800 stades distant from each other.<a name="FNanchor_779" id="FNanchor_779"></a><a href="#Footnote_779" class="fnanchor">779</a> In the
voyage down he arrived at a large lake in the mouth of
the river, which the river makes by spreading itself out;
or perhaps the waters of the surrounding district draining
into it make it large, so that it very much resembles
a gulf of the sea.<a name="FNanchor_780" id="FNanchor_780"></a><a href="#Footnote_780" class="fnanchor">780</a> For in it were seen fish like those
in the sea, larger indeed than those in our sea. Having
moored his ships then in this lake, where the pilots
directed, he left there most of the soldiers and all the
boats with Leonnatus; but he himself with the thirty-oared
galleys and the vessels with one and a half row
of oars passed beyond the mouth of the Indus, and ad<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>vancing
into the sea also this way, ascertained that the
outlet of the river on this side (<i>i.e.</i> the west) was easier
to navigate than the other. He moored his ships near
the shore, and taking with him some of the cavalry went
along the sea-coast three days’ journey, exploring what
kind of country it was for a coasting voyage, and ordering
wells to be dug, so that the sailors might have water to
drink. He then returned to the ships and sailed back to
Patala; but he sent a part of his army along the sea-coast
to effect the same thing, instructing them to return to
Patala when they had dug the wells. Sailing again down
to the lake, he there constructed another harbour and
dockyard; and leaving a garrison for the place, he collected
sufficient food to supply the army for four months,
as well as whatever else he could procure for the coasting
voyage.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXI.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Campaign against the Oritians.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">The</span> season of the year was then unfit for voyaging; for
the periodical winds prevailed, which at that season do
not blow there from the north, as with us, but from the
Great Sea, in the direction of the south wind.<a name="FNanchor_781" id="FNanchor_781"></a><a href="#Footnote_781" class="fnanchor">781</a> Moreover
it was reported that there the sea was fit for navigation
after the beginning of winter, from the setting of the
Pleiades<a name="FNanchor_782" id="FNanchor_782"></a><a href="#Footnote_782" class="fnanchor">782</a> until the winter solstice; for at that season
mild breezes usually blow from the land, drenched as it
has been with great rains; and these winds are convenient
on a coasting voyage both for oars and sails.
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>Nearchus, who had been placed in command of the fleet,
waited for the coasting season; but Alexander, starting
from Patala, advanced with all his army as far as the
river Arabius.<a name="FNanchor_783" id="FNanchor_783"></a><a href="#Footnote_783" class="fnanchor">783</a> He then took half of the shield-bearing
guards and archers, the infantry regiments called foot
Companions, the guard of the Companion cavalry, a
squadron of each of the other cavalry regiments, and all
the horse-bowmen, and turned away thence on the left
towards the sea to dig wells, so that there might be
abundance of them for the fleet sailing along on the
coasting voyage; and at the same time to make an
unexpected attack upon the Oritians,<a name="FNanchor_784" id="FNanchor_784"></a><a href="#Footnote_784" class="fnanchor">784</a> a tribe of the
Indians in this region, which had long been independent.
This he meditated doing because they had performed no
friendly act either to himself or his army. He placed
Hephaestion in command of the forces left behind. The
Arabitians,<a name="FNanchor_785" id="FNanchor_785"></a><a href="#Footnote_785" class="fnanchor">785</a> another independent tribe dwelling near the
river Arabius, thinking that they could not cope with
Alexander in battle, and yet being unwilling to submit
to him, fled into the desert when they heard that he was
approaching. But crossing the river Arabius, which
was both narrow and shallow, and travelling by night
through the greater part of the desert, he came near
the inhabited country at daybreak. Then ordering the
infantry to follow him in regular line, he took the cavalry
with him, dividing it into squadrons, that it might
occupy a very large part of the plain, and thus marched
into the land of the Oritians. All those who turned to
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>defend themselves were cut to pieces by the cavalry, and
many of the others were taken prisoners. He then
encamped near a small piece of water; but when
Hephaestion formed a junction with him, he advanced
farther. Arriving at the largest village of the tribe of
the Oritians, which was called Rhambacia,<a name="FNanchor_786" id="FNanchor_786"></a><a href="#Footnote_786" class="fnanchor">786</a> he commended
the place and thought that if he colonized a city there
it would become great and prosperous. He therefore
left Hephaestion behind to carry out this project.<a name="FNanchor_787" id="FNanchor_787"></a><a href="#Footnote_787" class="fnanchor">787</a></p>

<hr />

<h3>CHAPTER XXII.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">March through the Desert of Gadrosia.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Again</span> he took half of the shield-bearing guards and
Agrianians, the guard of cavalry and the horse-bowmen,
and marched forward to the confines of the Gadrosians
and Oritians, where he was informed that the passage
was narrow, and the Oritians were drawn up with the
Gadrosians and were encamping in front of the pass, with
the purpose of barring Alexander’s passage. They had
indeed marshalled themselves there; but when it was
reported that he was already approaching, most of them
fled from the pass, deserting their guard. The chiefs of
the Oritians, however, came to him, offering to surrender
both themselves and their nation. He instructed these
to collect the multitude of their people together and send
them to their own abodes, since they were not about to
suffer any harm. Over these people he placed Apollophanes
as viceroy, and with him he left Leonnatus the
confidential body-guard in Ora,<a name="FNanchor_788" id="FNanchor_788"></a><a href="#Footnote_788" class="fnanchor">788</a> at the head of all the
Agrianians, some of the bowmen and cavalry, and the
rest of the Grecian mercenary infantry and cavalry. He
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>instructed him to wait until the fleet had sailed round
the land, to colonize the city, and to regulate the affairs
of the Oritians so that they might pay the greater respect
to the viceroy. He himself, with the main body of the
army (for Hephaestion had arrived at the head of the
men who had been left behind), advanced into the land
of the Gadrosians by a route most of which was desert.
Aristobulus says that in this desert many myrrh-trees
grew, larger than the ordinary kind; and that the
Phoenicians, who accompanied the army for trafficking,
gathered the gum of myrrh, and loading the beasts of
burden, carried it away.<a name="FNanchor_789" id="FNanchor_789"></a><a href="#Footnote_789" class="fnanchor">789</a> For there was a great
quantity of it, inasmuch as it exuded from large stems
and had never before been gathered. He also says that
this desert produces many odoriferous roots of nard,<a name="FNanchor_790" id="FNanchor_790"></a><a href="#Footnote_790" class="fnanchor">790</a>
which the Phoenicians likewise gathered; but much of
it was trampled down by the army, and a sweet perfume
was diffused far and wide over the land by the trampling;
so great was the abundance of it. In the desert there
were also other kinds of trees, one of which had foliage
like that of the bay-tree, and grew in places washed by
the waves of the sea. These trees were on ground which
was left dry by the ebb-tide; but when the water
advanced they looked as if they had grown in the sea.
Of others the roots were always washed by the sea,
because they grew in hollow places, from which the
water could not retire; and yet the trees were not
destroyed by the sea. Some of these trees in this region
were even thirty cubits high. At that season they
happened to be in bloom; and the flower was very much
like the white violet,<a name="FNanchor_791" id="FNanchor_791"></a><a href="#Footnote_791" class="fnanchor">791</a> but the perfume was far superior
to that of the latter. There was also another thorny
stalk growing out of the earth, the thorn on which was
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>so strong that, piercing the clothes of some men just
riding past, it pulled the horseman down from his horse
rather than be itself torn off the stalk. It is also said
that when hares run past these bushes, the thorns cling
to their fur; and thus these animals are caught, as birds
are with bird-lime, or fish with hooks. However they
were easily cut through with steel; and when the thorns
are cut the stalk gives forth much juice, still more abundantly
than fig-trees do in the springtime, and more
pungent.<a name="FNanchor_792" id="FNanchor_792"></a><a href="#Footnote_792" class="fnanchor">792</a></p>

<hr />

<h3>CHAPTER XXIII.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">March through the Desert of Gadrosia.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Thence</span> Alexander marched through the land of the
Gadrosians, by a difficult route, which was also destitute
of all the necessaries of life; and in many places there
was no water for the army. Moreover they were compelled
to march most of the way by night, and a great
distance from the sea. However he was very desirous of
coming to the part of the country along the sea, both
to see what harbours were there, and to make what
preparations he could on his march for the fleet, either
by employing his men in digging wells, or by making
arrangements somewhere for a market and anchorage.
But the part of the country of the Gadrosians near the
sea was entirely desert. He therefore sent Thoas, son of
Mandrodorus, with a few horsemen down to the sea, to
reconnoitre and see if there happened to be any haven
anywhere near, or whether there was water or any other
of the necessaries of life not far from the sea. This man
returned and reported that he found some fishermen
upon the shore living in stifling huts, which were made
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span>by putting together mussel-shells, and the back-bones
of fishes were used to form the roofs.<a name="FNanchor_793" id="FNanchor_793"></a><a href="#Footnote_793" class="fnanchor">793</a> He also said that
these fishermen used little water, obtaining it with difficulty
by scraping away the gravel, and that what they
got was not at all fresh. When Alexander reached a
certain place in Gadrosia, where corn was more abundant,
he seized it and placed it upon the beasts of burden;
and marking it with his own seal, he ordered it to be
conveyed down to the sea. But while he was marching
to the halting stage nearest to the sea, the soldiers paying
little regard to the seal, the guards made use of the
corn themselves, and gave a share of it to those who
were especially pinched with hunger. To such a degree
were they overcome by their misery that after mature
deliberation they resolved to take account of the visible
and already impending destruction rather than the danger
of incurring the king’s wrath, which was not before their
eyes and still remote. When Alexander ascertained the
necessity which constrained them so to act, he pardoned
those who had done the deed. He himself hastened forward
to collect from the land all he could for victualling
the army which was sailing round with the fleet; and sent
Cretheus the Callatian<a name="FNanchor_794" id="FNanchor_794"></a><a href="#Footnote_794" class="fnanchor">794</a> to convey the supplies to the coast.
He also ordered the natives to grind as much corn as
they could and convey it down from the interior of the
country, together with dates<a name="FNanchor_795" id="FNanchor_795"></a><a href="#Footnote_795" class="fnanchor">795</a> and sheep for sale to the
soldiers. Moreover he sent Telephus, one of the confidential
Companions, down to another place on the coast
with a small quantity of ground corn.</p>

<hr />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIV.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">March through Gadrosia.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">He</span> then advanced towards the capital of the Gadrosians,
which was named Pura<a name="FNanchor_796" id="FNanchor_796"></a><a href="#Footnote_796" class="fnanchor">796</a>; and he arrived there in sixty
days after starting from Ora. Most of the historians of
Alexander’s reign assert that all the hardships which his
army suffered in Asia were not worthy of comparison
with the labours undergone here. Nearchus alone
asserts that Alexander pursued this route, not from
ignorance of the difficulty of the journey, but because he
heard that no one had ever hitherto passed that way
with an army and emerged in safety from the desert,
except Semiramis, when she fled from India. The
natives said that even she emerged with only twenty
men of her army; and that Cyrus, son of Cambyses,
escaped with only seven of his men.<a name="FNanchor_797" id="FNanchor_797"></a><a href="#Footnote_797" class="fnanchor">797</a> For they say that
Cyrus also marched into this region for the purpose of
invading India; but that he did not effect his retreat
before losing the greater part of his army, from the
desert and the other difficulties of this route. When
Alexander received this information he was seized with
a desire of excelling Cyrus and Semiramis. Nearchus
says that he turned his march this way, both for this
reason and at the same time for the purpose of conveying
provisions near the fleet. The scorching heat and lack
of water destroyed a great part of the army, and especially
the beasts of burden; most of which perished
from thirst and some of them even from the depth and
heat of the sand, because it had been thoroughly scorched
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>by the sun. For they met with lofty ridges of deep sand,
not closely pressed and hardened, but such as received
those who stepped upon it just as if they were stepping
into mud, or rather into untrodden snow. At the same
time too the horses and mules suffered still more, both in
going up and coming down the hills, from the unevenness
of the road as well as from its instability. The length
of the marches between the stages also exceedingly distressed
the army; for the lack of water often compelled
them to make the marches of unusual length.<a name="FNanchor_798" id="FNanchor_798"></a><a href="#Footnote_798" class="fnanchor">798</a> When
they travelled by night on a journey which it was
necessary to complete, and at daybreak came to water,
they suffered no hardship at all; but if, while still on
the march, on account of the length of the way, they were
caught by the heat, then they did indeed suffer hardships
from the blazing sun, being at the same time oppressed
by unassuageable thirst.<a name="FNanchor_799" id="FNanchor_799"></a><a href="#Footnote_799" class="fnanchor">799</a></p>

<hr />

<h3>CHAPTER XXV.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sufferings of the Army.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">The</span> soldiers killed many of the beasts of burden of their
own accord; for when provisions were lacking, they
came together, and slaughtered most of the horses and
mules. They ate the flesh of these, and said that they
had died of thirst or had perished from the heat. There
was no one who divulged the real truth of their conduct,
both on account of the men’s distress and because all
alike were implicated in the same offence. What was
being done had not escaped Alexander’s notice; but he
saw that the best cure for the present state of affairs
would be to pretend to be ignorant of it, rather than to
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span>permit it as a thing known to himself. The consequence
was, that it was no longer easy to convey the soldiers
who were suffering from disease, or those who were left
behind on the roads on account of the heat, partly from
the want of beasts of burden and partly because the
men themselves were knocking the waggons to pieces,
not being able to draw them on account of the depth of
the sand. They did this also because in the first stages
they were compelled on this account to go, not by the
shortest routes, but by those which were easiest for the
carriages. Thus some were left behind along the roads
on account of sickness, others from fatigue or the effects
of the heat, or from not being able to bear up against
the drought; and there was no one either to show them
the way or to remain and tend them in their sickness.
For the expedition was being made with great urgency;
and the care of individual persons was necessarily
neglected in the zeal displayed for the safety of the
army as a whole. As they generally made the marches
by night, some of the men were overcome by sleep on
the road; afterwards rousing up again, those who still had
strength followed upon the tracks of the army; but only
a few out of many overtook the main body in safety.
Most of them perished in the sand, like men shipwrecked
on the sea.<a name="FNanchor_800" id="FNanchor_800"></a><a href="#Footnote_800" class="fnanchor">800</a> Another calamity also befell the army,
which greatly distressed men, horses, and beasts of
burden; for the country of the Gadrosians is supplied
with rain by the periodical winds, just as that of the
Indians is; not the plains of Gadrosia, but only the
mountains where the clouds are carried by the wind and
are dissolved into rain without passing beyond the summits
of the mountains. On one occasion, when the army
bivouacked, for the sake of its water, near a small brook
which was a winter torrent, about the second watch of
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span>the night the brook which flowed there was suddenly
swelled by the rains in the mountains which had fallen
unperceived by the soldiers. The torrent advanced with
so great a flood as to destroy most of the wives and
children of the men who followed the army, and to sweep
away all the royal baggage as well as all the beasts of
burden still remaining. The soldiers, after great exertions,
were hardly able to save themselves together with
their weapons, many of which they lost beyond recovery.
When, after enduring the burning heat and thirst, they
lighted upon abundance of water, many of them perished
from drinking to excess, not being able to check their
appetite for it. For this reason Alexander generally
pitched his camp, not near the water itself, but at a
distance of about twenty stades from it, to prevent the
men and beasts from pressing in crowds into the river
and thus perishing, and at the same time to prevent
those who had no control over themselves from fouling
the water for the rest of the army by stepping into the
springs or streams.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER XXVI.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Alexander’s Magnanimous Conduct.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Here</span> I have resolved not to pass over in silence the
most noble deed perhaps ever performed by Alexander,
which occurred either in this land or, according to the
assertion of some other authors, still earlier, among the
Parapamisadians.<a name="FNanchor_801" id="FNanchor_801"></a><a href="#Footnote_801" class="fnanchor">801</a> The army was continuing its march
through the sand, though the heat of the sun was already
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span>scorching, because it was necessary to reach water before
halting. They were far on the journey, and Alexander
himself, though oppressed with thirst, was nevertheless
with great pain and difficulty leading the army on foot,
so that his soldiers, as is usual in such a case, might
more patiently bear their hardships by the equalization
of the distress. At this time some of the light-armed
soldiers, starting away from the army in quest of water,
found some collected in a shallow cleft, a small and
mean spring. Collecting this water with difficulty, they
came with all speed to Alexander, as if they were bringing
him some great boon. As soon as they approached
the king, they poured the water into a helmet and carried
it to him. He took it, and commending the men
who brought it, immediately poured it upon the ground
in the sight of all. As a result of this action, the entire
army was re-invigorated to so great a degree that any
one would have imagined that the water poured away by
Alexander had furnished a draught to every man. This
deed beyond all others I commend as evidence of Alexander’s
power of endurance and self-control, as well as of
his skill in managing an army. The following adventure
also occurred to the army in that country. At last
the guides declared that they no longer remembered the
way, because the tracks of it had been rendered invisible
by the wind blowing the sand over them. Moreover,
in the deep sand which had been everywhere reduced to
one level, there was nothing by which they could conjecture
the right way, not even the usual trees growing
along it, nor any solid hillock rising up; and they had
not practised themselves in making journeys by the stars
at night or by the sun in the daytime, as sailors do by
the constellations of the Bears&mdash;the Phoenicians by the
Little Bear, and other men by the Greater Bear.<a name="FNanchor_802" id="FNanchor_802"></a><a href="#Footnote_802" class="fnanchor">802</a> Then
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">360</a></span>at length Alexander perceived that it was necessary for
him to lead the way by declining to the left; and taking
a few horsemen with him he advanced in front of the
army. But when the horses even of these were exhausted
by the heat, he left most of these men behind,
and rode away with only five men and found the sea.
Having scraped away the shingle on the sea-beach, he
found water fresh and pure, and then went and fetched
the whole army. For seven days they marched along
the sea-coast, supplying themselves with water from the
shore. Thence he led his expedition into the interior,
for now the guides knew the way.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXVII.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">March through Carmania.&mdash;Punishment of Viceroys.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">When</span> he arrived at the capital of Gadrosia, he there
gave his army a rest. He deposed Apollophanes from
the viceroyalty,<a name="FNanchor_803" id="FNanchor_803"></a><a href="#Footnote_803" class="fnanchor">803</a> because he discovered that he had paid
no heed to his instructions. Thoas was appointed viceroy
over the people of this district; but as he fell ill and
died, Sibyrtius succeeded to the office. The same man
had also lately been appointed by Alexander viceroy of
Carmania; but now the rule over the Arachotians and
Gadrosians was given to him, and Tlepolemus, son of
Pythophanes, received Carmania. The king was already
advancing into Carmania, when news was brought to
him that Philip, the viceroy of the country of the Indians,
had been plotted against by the mercenaries and treacherously
killed; but that Philip’s Macedonian body-guards
had caught some of the murderers in the very
act and others afterwards, and had put them to death.
When be had ascertained this, he sent a letter into India
to Eudemus and Taxiles, ordering them to administer
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">361</a></span>the affairs of the land which had previously been subordinated
to Philip until he could send a viceroy for it.
When he arrived in Carmania, Craterus effected a junction
with him, bringing with him the rest of the army
and the elephants. He also brought Ordanes, whom he
had arrested for revolting and trying to effect a revolution.<a name="FNanchor_804" id="FNanchor_804"></a><a href="#Footnote_804" class="fnanchor">804</a>
Thither also came Stasanor, the viceroy of the
Areians<a name="FNanchor_805" id="FNanchor_805"></a><a href="#Footnote_805" class="fnanchor">805</a> and Zarangians, accompanied by Pharismanes,
son of Phrataphernes, the viceroy of the Parthians and
Hyrcanians. There came also the generals who had
been left with Parmenio over the army in Media, Cleander,
Sitalces, and Heracon, bringing with them the
greater part of their army. Both the natives and the
soldiers themselves brought many accusations against
Cleander and Sitalces, as for example, that the temples
had been pillaged by them, old tombs rifled, and other
acts of injustice, recklessness, and tyranny perpetrated
against their subjects. As these charges were proved,<a name="FNanchor_806" id="FNanchor_806"></a><a href="#Footnote_806" class="fnanchor">806</a>
he put them to death, in order to inspire others who
might be left as viceroys, governors, or prefects of provinces
with the fear of suffering equal penalties with
them if they swerved from the path of duty.<a name="FNanchor_807" id="FNanchor_807"></a><a href="#Footnote_807" class="fnanchor">807</a> This was
one of the chief means by which Alexander kept in subordination
the nations which he had conquered in war
or which had voluntarily submitted to him, though they
were so many in number and so far distant from each
other; because under his regal sway it was not allowed
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span>that those who were ruled should be unjustly treated by
those who ruled. At that time Heracon was acquitted of
the charge, but soon after, being convicted by the men
of Susa of having pillaged the temple in that city, he
also suffered punishment. Stasanor and Phrataphernes
came to Alexander bringing a multitude of beasts of
burden and many camels, when they learnt that he was
marching by the route to Gadrosia, conjecturing that his
army would suffer the very hardships which it did suffer.
Therefore these men arrived just at the very time they
were required, as also did their camels and beasts of burden.
For Alexander distributed all these animals to the
officers man by man, to all the various squadrons and
centuries of the cavalry, and to the various companies
of the infantry, as their number allowed him.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Alexander in Carmania.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Certain</span> authors have said (though to me the statement
seems incredible) that Alexander led his forces through
Carmania lying extended with his Companions upon two
covered waggons joined together, the flute being played to
him; and that the soldiers followed him wearing garlands
and sporting. Food was provided for them, as well as
all kinds of dainties which had been brought together
along the roads by the Carmanians. They say that he
did this in imitation of the Bacchic revelry of Dionysus,
because a story was told about that deity, that after
subduing the Indians he traversed the greater part of
Asia in this manner and received the appellation of
Thriambus.<a name="FNanchor_808" id="FNanchor_808"></a><a href="#Footnote_808" class="fnanchor">808</a> For the same reason the processions in
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span>honour of victories after war were called <i>thriambi</i>. This
has been recorded neither by Ptolemy, son of Lagus, nor
by Aristobulus, son of Aristobulus, nor by any other
writer whose testimony on such points any one would feel
to be worthy of credit. It is sufficient therefore for me
to record it as unworthy of belief.<a name="FNanchor_809" id="FNanchor_809"></a><a href="#Footnote_809" class="fnanchor">809</a> But as to what I am
now going to describe I follow the account of Aristobulus.
In Carmania Alexander offered sacrifices to the
gods as thank-offerings for his victory over the Indians,
and because his army had been brought in safety out of
Gadrosia. He also celebrated a musical and gymnastic
contest. He then appointed Peucestas one of his confidential
body-guards, having already resolved to make
him viceroy of Persis. He wished him, before being
appointed to the viceroyalty, to experience this honour
and evidence of confidence, as a reward for his exploit
among the Mallians. Up to this time the number of his
confidential body-guards had been seven:&mdash;Leonnatus,
son of Anteas, Hephaestion, son of Amyntor, Lysimachus,
son of Agathocles, Aristonoüs, son of Pisaeus, these four
being Pellaeans; Perdiccas, son of Orontes, from Orestis,
Ptolemy, son of Lagus, and Peithon, son of Crateas, the
Heordaeans. Peucestas, who had held the shield over
Alexander, was now added to them as an eighth. At
this time Nearchus, having sailed round the coast of Ora
and Gadrosia and that of the Ichthyophagi, put into port
in the inhabited part of the coastland of Carmania,<a name="FNanchor_810" id="FNanchor_810"></a><a href="#Footnote_810" class="fnanchor">810</a> and
going up thence into the interior with a few men he reported
to Alexander the particulars of the voyage which he
had made along the coasts of the external sea. Nearchus
was then sent down to the sea again to sail round as far
as the country of Susiana, and the outlets of the river
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span>Tigres.<a name="FNanchor_811" id="FNanchor_811"></a><a href="#Footnote_811" class="fnanchor">811</a> How he sailed from the river Indus to the
Persian Sea and the mouth of the Tigres, I shall describe
in a separate book, following the account of Nearchus
himself.<a name="FNanchor_812" id="FNanchor_812"></a><a href="#Footnote_812" class="fnanchor">812</a> For he also wrote a history of Alexander in
Greek. Perhaps I shall be able to compose this narrative
in the future, if inclination and the divine influence
urge me to it. Alexander now ordered Hephaestion to
march into Persis<a name="FNanchor_813" id="FNanchor_813"></a><a href="#Footnote_813" class="fnanchor">813</a> from Carmania along the seashore
with the larger division of the army and the beasts of
burden, taking with him also the elephants; because, as
he was making the expedition in the season of winter,<a name="FNanchor_814" id="FNanchor_814"></a><a href="#Footnote_814" class="fnanchor">814</a>
the part of Persis near the sea was warm and possessed
abundant supplies of provisions.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER XXIX.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Alexander in Persis.&mdash;Tomb of Cyrus Repaired.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">He</span> himself then marched to Pasargadae in Persis, with
the lightest of his infantry, the Companion cavalry and
a part of the archers; but he sent Stasanor down to his
own land.<a name="FNanchor_815" id="FNanchor_815"></a><a href="#Footnote_815" class="fnanchor">815</a> When he arrived at the confines of Persis,
he found that Phrasaortes was no longer viceroy, for he
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span>happened to have died of disease while Alexander was
still in India. Orxines was managing the affairs of the
country, not because he had been appointed ruler by
Alexander, but because he thought it his duty to keep
Persia in order for him, as there was no other ruler.<a name="FNanchor_816" id="FNanchor_816"></a><a href="#Footnote_816" class="fnanchor">816</a>
Atropates, the viceroy of Media, also came to Pasargadae,
bringing Baryaxes, a Mede, under arrest, because he had
assumed the upright head-dress and called himself king
of the Persians and Medes.<a name="FNanchor_817" id="FNanchor_817"></a><a href="#Footnote_817" class="fnanchor">817</a> With Baryaxes he also
brought those who had taken part with him in the attempted
revolution and revolt. Alexander put these
men to death.</p>

<p>He was grieved by the outrage committed upon the
tomb of Cyrus, son of Cambyses; for according to
Aristobulus, he found it dug through and pillaged. The
tomb of the famous Cyrus was in the royal park at Pasargadae,
and around it a grove of all kinds of trees had
been planted. It was also watered by a stream, and
high grass grew in the meadow. The base of the tomb
itself had been made of squared stone in the form of a
rectangle. Above there was a stone building surmounted
by a roof, with a door leading within, so narrow that
even a small man could with difficulty enter, after suffering
much discomfort.<a name="FNanchor_818" id="FNanchor_818"></a><a href="#Footnote_818" class="fnanchor">818</a> In the building lay a golden
coffin, in which the body of Cyrus had been buried, and
by the side of the coffin was a couch, the feet of which
were of gold wrought with the hammer. A carpet of
Babylonian tapestry with purple rugs formed the bedding;
upon it were also a Median coat with sleeves and
other tunics of Babylonian manufacture. Aristobulus
adds that Median trousers and robes dyed the colour of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span>hyacinth were also lying upon it, as well as others of
purple and various other colours; moreover there were
collars, sabres, and earrings of gold and precious stones
soldered together, and near them stood a table. On the
middle of the couch lay the coffin<a name="FNanchor_819" id="FNanchor_819"></a><a href="#Footnote_819" class="fnanchor">819</a> which contained the
body of Cyrus. Within the enclosure, near the ascent
leading to the tomb, there was a small house built for the
Magians who guarded the tomb; a duty which they had
discharged ever since the time of Cambyses, son of Cyrus,
son succeeding father as guard. To these men a sheep
and specified quantities of wheaten flour and wine were
given daily by the king; and a horse once a month as a
sacrifice to Cyrus. Upon the tomb an inscription in
Persian letters had been placed, which bore the following
meaning in the Persian language: “O man, I am Cyrus,
son of Cambyses, who founded the empire of the Persians,
and was king of Asia. Do not therefore grudge me this
monument.” As soon as Alexander had conquered
Persia, he was very desirous of entering the tomb of
Cyrus; but he found that everything else had been
carried off except the coffin and couch. They had even
maltreated the king’s body; for they had torn off the
lid of the coffin and cast out the corpse. They had tried
to make the coffin itself of smaller bulk and thus more
portable, by cutting part of it off and crushing part of
it up; but as their efforts did not succeed, they departed,
leaving the coffin in that state. Aristobulus
says that he was himself commissioned by Alexander to
restore the tomb for Cyrus, to put in the coffin the parts
of the body still preserved, to put the lid on, and to restore
the parts of the coffin which had been defaced.
Moreover he was instructed to stretch the couch tight
with bands, and to deposit all the other things which
used to lie there for ornament, both resembling the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span>former ones and of the same number. He was ordered
also to do away with the door, building part of it up with
stone and plastering part of it over with cement; and finally
to put the royal seal upon the cement. Alexander
arrested the Magians who were the guards of the tomb,
and put them to the torture to make them confess who
had done the deed; but in spite of the torture they confessed
nothing either about themselves or any other person.
In no other way were they proved to have been
privy to the deed; they were therefore released by
Alexander.<a name="FNanchor_820" id="FNanchor_820"></a><a href="#Footnote_820" class="fnanchor">820</a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXX.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Peucestas Appointed Viceroy of Persis.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Thence</span> he proceeded to the royal palace of the Persians,
which he had on a former occasion himself burnt down,
as I have previously related, expressing my disapprobation
of the act<a name="FNanchor_821" id="FNanchor_821"></a><a href="#Footnote_821" class="fnanchor">821</a>; and on his return Alexander himself did
not commend it. Many charges were brought by the
Persians against Orxines, who ruled them after the death
of Phrasaortes. He was convicted of having pillaged
temples and royal tombs, and of having unjustly put
many of the Persians to death. He was therefore hanged
by men acting under Alexander’s orders<a name="FNanchor_822" id="FNanchor_822"></a><a href="#Footnote_822" class="fnanchor">822</a>; and Peucestas
the confidential body-guard was appointed viceroy of
Persis. The king placed special confidence in him both
for other reasons, and especially on account of his exploit
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span>among the Mallians, where he braved the greatest
dangers and helped to save Alexander’s life. Besides
this, he did not refuse to accommodate himself to the
Asiatic mode of living; and as soon as he was appointed
to the position of viceroy of Persis, he openly assumed
the native garb, being the only man among the Macedonians
who adopted the Median dress in preference to
the Grecian.<a name="FNanchor_823" id="FNanchor_823"></a><a href="#Footnote_823" class="fnanchor">823</a> He also learnt to speak the Persian language
correctly, and comported himself in all other respects
like a Persian. For this conduct he was not
only commended by Alexander, but the Persians also
were highly delighted with him, for preferring their
national customs to those of his own forefathers.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Alexander’s Plans.&mdash;The Indian Philosophers.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">When</span> Alexander arrived at Pasargadae and Persepolis,<a name="FNanchor_824" id="FNanchor_824"></a><a href="#Footnote_824" class="fnanchor">824</a>
he was seized with an ardent desire to sail down the
Euphrates and Tigres<a name="FNanchor_825" id="FNanchor_825"></a><a href="#Footnote_825" class="fnanchor">825</a> to the Persian Sea, and to see the
mouths of those rivers as he had already seen those of
the Indus as well as the sea into which it flows. Some
authors<a name="FNanchor_826" id="FNanchor_826"></a><a href="#Footnote_826" class="fnanchor">826</a> also have stated that he was meditating a voyage
round the larger portion of Arabia, the country of the
Ethiopians, Libya (<i>i.e.</i> Africa), and Numidia beyond
Mount Atlas to Gadeira (<i>i.e.</i> Cadiz),<a name="FNanchor_827" id="FNanchor_827"></a><a href="#Footnote_827" class="fnanchor">827</a> inward into our sea
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">370</a></span>(<i>i.e.</i> the Mediterranean); thinking that after he had
subdued both Libya and Carchedon (<i>i.e.</i> Carthage), he
might with justice be called king of all Asia.<a name="FNanchor_828" id="FNanchor_828"></a><a href="#Footnote_828" class="fnanchor">828</a> For he
said that the kings of the Persians and Medes called
themselves Great Kings without any right, since they
did not rule the larger part of Asia. Some say that he
was meditating a voyage thence into the Euxine Sea, to
Scythia and the Lake Maeotis (<i>i.e.</i> the Sea of Azov);
while others assert that he intended to go to Sicily and
the Iapygian Cape,<a name="FNanchor_829" id="FNanchor_829"></a><a href="#Footnote_829" class="fnanchor">829</a> for the fame of the Romans spreading
far and wide was now exciting his jealousy. For my
own part I cannot conjecture with any certainty what
were his plans; and I do not care to guess. But this I
think I can confidently affirm, that he meditated nothing
small or mean; and that he would never have remained
satisfied with any of the acquisitions he had made, even
if he had added Europe to Asia, or the islands of the
Britons to Europe; but would still have gone on seeking
for unknown lands beyond those mentioned. I verily
believe that if he had found no one else to strive with,
he would have striven with himself. And on this account
I commend some of the Indian philosophers, who are
said to have been caught by Alexander as they were
walking in the open meadow where they were accustomed
to spend their time.<a name="FNanchor_830" id="FNanchor_830"></a><a href="#Footnote_830" class="fnanchor">830</a> At the sight of him and his army
they did nothing else but stamp with their feet on the
earth, upon which they were stepping. When he asked
them by means of interpreters what was the meaning of
their action, they replied as follows: “O king Alexander,
every man possesses as much of the earth as this upon
which we have stepped; but thou being only a man like
the rest of us, except in being meddlesome and arrogant,
art come over so great a part of the earth from thy own
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span>land, giving trouble both to thyself and others.<a name="FNanchor_831" id="FNanchor_831"></a><a href="#Footnote_831" class="fnanchor">831</a> And
yet thou also wilt soon die, and possess only as much of
the earth as is sufficient for thy body to be buried in.”</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Alexander’s Dealings with the Indian Sages.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">On</span> this occasion Alexander commended both the words
and the men who spoke them; but nevertheless he did
just the opposite to that which he commended. When
also in the Isthmus he met Diogenes of Sinope, lying in
the sun, standing near him with his shield-bearing guards
and foot Companions, he asked if he wanted anything.
But Diogenes said that he wanted nothing else, except
that he and his attendants would stand out of the sunlight.
Alexander is said to have expressed his admiration
of Diogenes’s conduct.<a name="FNanchor_832" id="FNanchor_832"></a><a href="#Footnote_832" class="fnanchor">832</a> Thus it is evident that
Alexander was not entirely destitute of better feelings;
but be was the slave of his insatiable ambition. Again,
when he arrived at Taxila and saw the naked sect of
Indian philosophers, he was exceedingly desirous that
one of these men should live with him; because he
admired their power of endurance.<a name="FNanchor_833" id="FNanchor_833"></a><a href="#Footnote_833" class="fnanchor">833</a> But the oldest of
the philosophers, Dandamis by name, of whom the others
were disciples, refused to come himself to Alexander, and
would not allow the others to do so.<a name="FNanchor_834" id="FNanchor_834"></a><a href="#Footnote_834" class="fnanchor">834</a> He is said to have
replied that he was himself a son of Zeus, if Alexander
was<a name="FNanchor_835" id="FNanchor_835"></a><a href="#Footnote_835" class="fnanchor">835</a>; and that he wanted nothing from him, because he
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">372</a></span>was quite contented with what he had. And besides he
said that he saw his attendants wandering over so much
of the land and sea to no advantage, and that there was
no end to their many wanderings. Therefore he had no
desire that Alexander should give him anything which
was in his own possession, nor on the other hand was he
afraid that he should be excluded from anything which
Alexander ruled over. For while he lived the country
of India, which produces the fruits in their season, was
sufficient for him; and when he died he should be released
from the body, an unsuitable associate. Alexander
then did not attempt to force him to come with him, considering
that the man was free to do as he pleased. But
Megasthenes has recorded that Calanus, one of the philosophers
of this region, who had very little power over
his desires, was induced to do so; and that the philosophers
themselves reproached him, for having deserted
the happiness existing among them, and serving another
lord instead of the God.<a name="FNanchor_836" id="FNanchor_836"></a><a href="#Footnote_836" class="fnanchor">836</a></p>

<hr />

<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Self-sacrifice of the Indian Calanus.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">This</span> I have recorded, because in a history of Alexander
it is necessary also to speak of Calanus; for when he
was in the country of Persis his health became delicate,
though he had never before been subject to illness.<a name="FNanchor_837" id="FNanchor_837"></a><a href="#Footnote_837" class="fnanchor">837</a>
Accordingly, not being willing to lead the life of a man
in infirm health, he told Alexander that in such circum<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">373</a></span>stances
he thought it best for him to put an end to his
existence, before he came into experience of any disease
which might compel him to change his former mode of
living. For a long time the king tried to dissuade him;
however, when he saw that he was not to be overcome,
but would find some other way of release, if this were
not yielded to him, he ordered a funeral pyre to be heaped
up for him, in the place where the man himself directed,
and gave instructions that Ptolemy, son of Lagus, the
confidential body-guard, should have the charge of it.
They say that a solemn procession, consisting both of
horses and men, advanced before him, some of the latter
being armed and others carrying all kinds of incense for
the pyre. They also say that they were carrying gold
and silver goblets and royal apparel; and because he
was unable to walk through illness, a horse was prepared
for him. However, not being able to mount the horse,
he was conveyed stretched out upon a litter, crowned
with a garland after the custom of the Indians, and singing
in the Indian language. The Indians say that he
sang hymns to the gods and eulogiums on his countrymen.<a name="FNanchor_838" id="FNanchor_838"></a><a href="#Footnote_838" class="fnanchor">838</a>
Before he ascended the funeral-pyre he presented
the horse which he should himself have mounted, being
a royal steed of the Nisaean breed,<a name="FNanchor_839" id="FNanchor_839"></a><a href="#Footnote_839" class="fnanchor">839</a> to Lysimachus, one
of those who attended him to learn his philosophy.
He distributed among his other disciples the goblets
and rugs which Alexander had ordered to be cast into
the pyre as an honour to him. Then mounting the pyre
he lay down upon it in a becoming manner, and was
visible to the whole army. To Alexander the spectacle
appeared unseemly, as it was being exhibited at the cost
of a friend; but to the rest it was a cause of wonder that
he did not move any part of his body in the fire.<a name="FNanchor_840" id="FNanchor_840"></a><a href="#Footnote_840" class="fnanchor">840</a> As
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">374</a></span>soon as the men to whom the duty had been assigned set
fire to the pyre, Nearchus says the trumpets sounded, in
accordance with Alexander’s order, and the whole army
raised the war-cry as it was in the habit of shouting
when advancing to battle. The elephants also chimed
in with their shrill and warlike cry, in honour of Calanus.
Authors upon whom reliance may be placed, have recorded
these and such-like things, facts of great import
to those who are desirous of learning how steadfast and
immovable a thing the human mind is in regard to what
it wishes to accomplish.</p>

viceroyalty,<a name="FNanchor_841" id="FNanchor_841"></a><a href="#Footnote_841" class="fnanchor">841</a> after advancing to Susa; where he arrested
Abulites and his son Oxathres, and put them to death on
the ground that they were governing the Susians badly.<a name="FNanchor_842" id="FNanchor_842"></a><a href="#Footnote_842" class="fnanchor">842</a>
Many outrages upon temples, tombs, and the subjects
themselves had been committed by those who were
ruling the countries conquered by Alexander in war; because
the king’s expedition into India had taken a long
time, and it was not thought credible that he would ever
return in safety from so many nations possessing so many
elephants, going to his destruction beyond the Indus,
Hydaspes, Acesines, and Hyphasis.<a name="FNanchor_843" id="FNanchor_843"></a><a href="#Footnote_843" class="fnanchor">843</a> The calamities that
befell him among the Gadrosians were still greater inducements
to those acting as viceroys in this region to
be free from apprehension of his return to his dominions.
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">375</a></span>Not only so, but Alexander himself is said to have become
more inclined at that time to believe accusations
which were plausible in every way, as well as to inflict
very severe punishment upon those who were convicted
even of small offences, because with the same disposition
he thought they would be likely to perform great ones.<a name="FNanchor_844" id="FNanchor_844"></a><a href="#Footnote_844" class="fnanchor">844</a></p>

<p>In Susa also he celebrated both his own wedding and
those of his companions. He himself married Barsine,
the eldest daughter of Darius,<a name="FNanchor_845" id="FNanchor_845"></a><a href="#Footnote_845" class="fnanchor">845</a> and according to Aristobulus,
besides her another, Parysatis, the youngest
daughter of Ochus.<a name="FNanchor_846" id="FNanchor_846"></a><a href="#Footnote_846" class="fnanchor">846</a> He had already married Roxana,
daughter of Oxyartes the Bactrian.<a name="FNanchor_847" id="FNanchor_847"></a><a href="#Footnote_847" class="fnanchor">847</a> To Hephaestion
he gave Drypetis, another daughter of Darius, and his
own wife’s sister; for he wished Hephaestion’s children
to be first cousins to his own. To Craterus he gave
Amastrine, daughter of Oxyartes the brother of Darius;
to Perdiccas, the daughter of Atropates, viceroy of
Media; to Ptolemy the confidential body-guard, and
Eumenes the royal secretary, the daughters of Artabazus,
to the former Artacama, and to the latter Artonis. To
Nearchus he gave the daughter of Barsine and Mentor;
to Seleucus the daughter of Spitamenes the Bactrian.
Likewise to the rest of his Companions he gave the
choicest daughters of the Persians and Medes, to the
number of eighty. The weddings were celebrated after
the Persian manner, seats being placed in a row for
the bridegrooms; and after the banquet the brides
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">376</a></span>came in and seated themselves, each one near her own
husband. The bridegrooms took them by the right
hand and kissed them; the king being the first to begin,
for the weddings of all were conducted in the same
way. This appeared the most popular thing which
Alexander ever did; and it proved his affection for his
Companions. Each man took his own bride and led her
away; and on all without exception Alexander bestowed
dowries.<a name="FNanchor_848" id="FNanchor_848"></a><a href="#Footnote_848" class="fnanchor">848</a> He also ordered that the names of all the
other Macedonians who had married any of the Asiatic
women should be registered. They were over 10,000 in
number; and to these Alexander made presents on
account of their weddings.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Soldiers Rewarded.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">He</span> now thought it a favourable opportunity to liquidate
the debts of all the soldiers who had incurred them<a name="FNanchor_849" id="FNanchor_849"></a><a href="#Footnote_849" class="fnanchor">849</a>;
and for this purpose he ordered that a register should be
made of how much each man owed, in order that they
might receive the money. At first only a few registered
their names, fearing that this was being instituted as a
test by Alexander, to discover which of the soldiers found
their pay insufficient for their expenses, and which of
them were extravagant in their mode of living. When
he was informed that most of them were not registering
their names, but that those who had borrowed money on
bonds were concealing the fact, he reproached them for
their distrust of him. For he said that it was not right
either that the king should deal otherwise than sincerely
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">377</a></span>with his subjects, or that any of those ruled by him
should think that he would deal otherwise than sincerely
with them. Accordingly, he had tables placed in the
camp with money upon them; and he appointed men to
manage the distribution of it. He ordered the debts of
all who showed a money-bond to be liquidated without
the debtors’ names being any longer registered. Consequently,
the men believed that Alexander was dealing
sincerely with them; and the fact that they were not
known was a greater pleasure to them than the fact that
they ceased to be in debt. This presentation to the
army is said to have amounted to 20,000 talents.<a name="FNanchor_850" id="FNanchor_850"></a><a href="#Footnote_850" class="fnanchor">850</a> He
also gave presents to particular individuals, according
as each man was held in honour for his merit or valour,
if he had become conspicuous in crises of danger.
Those who were distinguished for their personal gallantry
he crowned with golden chaplets:&mdash;first, Peucestas,
the man who had held the shield over him;
second, Leonnatus, who also had held his shield over
him, and moreover had incurred dangers in India and
won a victory in Ora.<a name="FNanchor_851" id="FNanchor_851"></a><a href="#Footnote_851" class="fnanchor">851</a> For he had posted himself with
the forces left with him against the Oritians and the
tribes living near them, who were trying to effect a
revolution, and had conquered them in battle. He also
seemed to have managed other affairs in Ora with great
success. In addition to these, he crowned Nearchus for
his successful voyage round the coast from the land of
the Indians through the Great Sea; for this officer had
now arrived at Susa. Besides these three, he crowned
Onesicritus, the pilot of the royal ship; as well as
Hephaestion and the rest of the confidential body-guards.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">An Army of Asiatics Trained under the Macedonian
Discipline.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">The</span> viceroys from the newly-built cities and the rest of
the territory subdued in war came to him, bringing with
them youths just growing into manhood to the number
of 30,000, all of the same age, whom Alexander called
Epigoni (successors).<a name="FNanchor_852" id="FNanchor_852"></a><a href="#Footnote_852" class="fnanchor">852</a> They were accoutred with Macedonian
arms, and exercised in military discipline after
the Macedonian system. The arrival of these is said to
have vexed the Macedonians, who thought that Alexander
was contriving every means in his power to free
himself from his previous need of their services. For
the same reason also the sight of his Median dress was
no small cause of dissatisfaction to them; and the weddings
celebrated in the Persian fashion were displeasing
to most of them, even including some of those who
married, although they had been greatly honoured by the
king putting himself on the same level with them in the
marriage ceremony. They were offended at Peucestas,
the viceroy of Persis, on account of his Persianizing both
in dress and in speech, because the king was delighted
by his adopting the Asiatic customs. They were disgusted
that the Bactrian, Sogdianian, Arachotian, Zarangian,
Arian, and Parthian horsemen, as well as
the Persian horsemen called the Evacae, were distributed
among the squadrons of the Companion cavalry; as
many of them at least as were seen to excel in reputation,
fineness of stature, or any other good quality; and
that a fifth cavalry division was added to these troops,
not composed entirely of foreigners; but the whole body
of cavalry was increased in number, and men were picked
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">379</a></span>from the foreigners and put into it. Cophen, son of
Artabazus, Hydarnes and Artiboles, sons of Mazaeus,
Sisines and Phradasmenes, sons of Phrataphernes, viceroy
of Parthia and Hyrcania, Histanes, son of Oxyartes and
brother of Alexander’s wife, Roxane, as well as Autobares
and his brother Mithrobaeus were picked out and enrolled
among the foot-guard in addition to the Macedonian
officers. Over these Hystaspes the Bactrian was
placed as commander; and Macedonian spears were
given to them instead of the barbarian javelins which
had thongs attached to them.<a name="FNanchor_853" id="FNanchor_853"></a><a href="#Footnote_853" class="fnanchor">853</a> All this offended the
Macedonians, who thought that Alexander was becoming
altogether Asiatic in his ideas, and was holding the
Macedonians themselves as well as their customs in a
position of contempt.<a name="FNanchor_854" id="FNanchor_854"></a><a href="#Footnote_854" class="fnanchor">854</a></p>

<hr />

<h3>CHAPTER VII.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Navigation of the Tigres.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Alexander</span> now ordered Hephaestion to lead the main
body of the infantry as far as the Persian Sea, while he
himself, his fleet having sailed up into the land of
Susiana, embarked with the shield-bearing guards and
the body-guard of infantry; and having also put on
board a few of the cavalry Companions, he sailed down
the river Eulaeus to the sea.<a name="FNanchor_855" id="FNanchor_855"></a><a href="#Footnote_855" class="fnanchor">855</a> When he was near the
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">380</a></span>place where the river discharges itself into the deep, he
left there most of his ships, including those which were
in need of repair, and with those especially adapted for
fast sailing he coasted along out of the river Eulaeus
through the sea to the mouth of the Tigres. The rest of
the ships were conveyed down the Eulaeus as far as the
canal which has been cut from the Tigres into the
Eulaeus, and by this means they were brought into the
Tigres. Of the rivers Euphrates and Tigres which
enclose Syria between them, whence also its name is
called by the natives Mesopotamia,<a name="FNanchor_856" id="FNanchor_856"></a><a href="#Footnote_856" class="fnanchor">856</a> the Tigres flows in a
much lower channel than the Euphrates, from which it
receives many canals; and after taking up many tributaries
and its waters being swelled by them, it falls into
the Persian Sea.<a name="FNanchor_857" id="FNanchor_857"></a><a href="#Footnote_857" class="fnanchor">857</a> It is a large river and can be crossed
on foot nowhere as far as its mouth,<a name="FNanchor_858" id="FNanchor_858"></a><a href="#Footnote_858" class="fnanchor">858</a> inasmuch as none
of its water is used up by irrigation of the country. For
the land through which it flows is more elevated than its
water, and it is not drawn off into canals or into another
river, but rather receives them into itself. It is nowhere
possible to irrigate the land from it. But the Euphrates
flows in an elevated channel, and is everywhere on a
level with the land through which it passes. Many
canals have been made from it, some of which are always
kept flowing, and from which the inhabitants on both
banks supply themselves with water; others the people
make only when requisite to irrigate the land, when they
are in need of water from drought.<a name="FNanchor_859" id="FNanchor_859"></a><a href="#Footnote_859" class="fnanchor">859</a> For this country
is usually free from rain. The consequence is, that the
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">381</a></span>Euphrates at last has only a small volume of water,
which disappears into a marsh. Alexander sailed over
the sea round the shore of the Persian Gulf lying
between the rivers Eulaeus and Tigres; and thence he
sailed up the latter river as far as the camp where
Hephaestion had settled with all his forces. Thence he
sailed again to Opis, a city situated on that river.<a name="FNanchor_860" id="FNanchor_860"></a><a href="#Footnote_860" class="fnanchor">860</a> In
his voyage up he destroyed the weirs which existed in
the river, and thus made the stream quite level. These
weirs had been constructed by the Persians, to prevent
any enemy having a superior naval force from sailing
up from the sea into their country. The Persians had
had recourse to these contrivances because they were not
a nautical people; and thus by making an unbroken
succession of weirs they had rendered the voyage up the
Tigres a matter of impossibility. But Alexander said
that such devices were unbecoming to men who are
victorious in battle; and therefore he considered this
means of safety unsuitable for him; and by easily
demolishing the laborious work of the Persians, he
proved in fact that what they thought a protection was
unworthy of the name.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Macedonians Offended at Alexander.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">When</span> he arrived at Opis, he collected the Macedonians
and announced that he intended to discharge from the
army those who were useless for military service either
from age or from being maimed in the limbs; and he
said he would send them back to their own abodes. He
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">382</a></span>also promised to give those who went back as much as
would make them special objects of envy to those at
home and arouse in the other Macedonians the wish to
share similar dangers and labours. Alexander said this,
no doubt, for the purpose of pleasing the Macedonians;
but on the contrary they were, not without reason,
offended by the speech which he delivered, thinking
that now they were despised by him and deemed to be
quite useless for military service. Indeed, throughout
the whole of this expedition they had been offended at
many other things; for his adoption of the Persian dress,
thereby exhibiting his contempt for their opinion, caused
them grief, as did also his accoutring the foreign soldiers
called Epigoni in the Macedonian style, and the mixing
of the alien horsemen among the ranks of the Companions.
Therefore they could not remain silent and
control themselves, but urged him to dismiss all of them
from his army; and they advised him to prosecute the
war in company with his father, deriding Ammon by this
remark. When Alexander heard this (for at that time
he was more hasty in temper than heretofore, and no
longer, as of old, indulgent to the Macedonians from
having a retinue of foreign attendants), leaping down
from the platform with his officers around him, he
ordered the most conspicuous of the men who had tried
to stir up the multitude to sedition to be arrested. He
himself pointed out with his hand to the shield-bearing
guards those whom they were to arrest, to the number of
thirteen; and he ordered these to be led away to execution.<a name="FNanchor_861" id="FNanchor_861"></a><a href="#Footnote_861" class="fnanchor">861</a>
When the rest, stricken with terror, became silent,
he mounted the platform and spoke as follows:&mdash;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Alexander’s Speech.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">“The</span> speech which I am about to deliver will not be
for the purpose of checking your start homeward, for, so
far as I am concerned, you may depart wherever you
wish; but because I wish you to know what kind of men
you were originally and how you have been transformed
since you came into our service. In the first place, as
is reasonable, I shall begin my speech from my father
Philip. For he found you vagabonds and destitute of
means, most of you clad in hides, feeding a few sheep up
the mountain sides, for the protection of which you had
to fight with small success against Illyrians, Triballians,
and the border Thracians.<a name="FNanchor_862" id="FNanchor_862"></a><a href="#Footnote_862" class="fnanchor">862</a> Instead of the hides he gave
you cloaks to wear, and from the mountains he led you
down into the plains, and made you capable of fighting
the neighbouring barbarians, so that you were no longer
compelled to preserve yourselves by trusting rather to
the inaccessible strongholds than to your own valour.
He made you colonists of cities, which he adorned with
useful laws and customs; and from being slaves and
subjects, he made you rulers over those very barbarians
by whom you yourselves, as well as your property, were
previously liable to be plundered and ravaged. He also
added the greater part of Thrace to Macedonia, and
by seizing the most conveniently situated places on the
sea-coast, he spread abundance over the land from commerce,
and made the working of the mines a secure
employment.<a name="FNanchor_863" id="FNanchor_863"></a><a href="#Footnote_863" class="fnanchor">863</a> He made you rulers over the Thessalians,
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">384</a></span>of whom you had formerly been in mortal fear<a name="FNanchor_864" id="FNanchor_864"></a><a href="#Footnote_864" class="fnanchor">864</a>; and
by humbling the nation of the Phocians, he rendered
the avenue into Greece broad and easy for you, instead
of being narrow and difficult.<a name="FNanchor_865" id="FNanchor_865"></a><a href="#Footnote_865" class="fnanchor">865</a> The Athenians and
Thebans, who were always lying in wait to attack
Macedonia, he humbled to such a degree,&mdash;I also then
rendering him my personal aid in the campaign,<a name="FNanchor_866" id="FNanchor_866"></a><a href="#Footnote_866" class="fnanchor">866</a>&mdash;that
instead of paying tribute to the former<a name="FNanchor_867" id="FNanchor_867"></a><a href="#Footnote_867" class="fnanchor">867</a> and being
vassals to the latter,<a name="FNanchor_868" id="FNanchor_868"></a><a href="#Footnote_868" class="fnanchor">868</a> those States in their turn procure
security to themselves by our assistance. He penetrated
into the Peloponnese, and after regulating its affairs,
was publicly declared commander-in-chief of all the rest
of Greece in the expedition against the Persian, adding
this glory not more to himself than to the commonwealth
of the Macedonians. These were the advantages
which accrued to you from my father Philip; great indeed
if looked at by themselves, but small if compared
with those you have obtained from me. For though I
inherited from my father only a few gold and silver
goblets, and there were not even sixty talents in the
treasury, and though I found myself charged with a debt
of 500 talents owing by Philip,<a name="FNanchor_869" id="FNanchor_869"></a><a href="#Footnote_869" class="fnanchor">869</a> and I was obliged myself
to borrow 800 talents in addition to these, I started from
the country which could not decently support you, and
forthwith laid open to you the passage of the Hellespont,
though at that time the Persians held the sovereignty
of the sea. Having overpowered the viceroys of Darius
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">385</a></span>with my cavalry, I added to your empire the whole of
Ionia,<a name="FNanchor_870" id="FNanchor_870"></a><a href="#Footnote_870" class="fnanchor">870</a> the whole of Aeolis, both Phrygias<a name="FNanchor_871" id="FNanchor_871"></a><a href="#Footnote_871" class="fnanchor">871</a> and Lydia,
and I took Miletus by siege. All the other places I
gained by voluntary surrender, and I granted you the
privilege of appropriating the wealth found in them. The
riches of Egypt and Cyrene, which I acquired without
fighting a battle, have come to you. Coele-Syria,
Palestine, and Mesopotamia are your property. Babylon,
Bactra, and Susa are yours. The wealth of the Lydians,
the treasures of the Persians, and the riches of the
Indians are yours; and so is the External Sea. You are
viceroys, you are generals, you are captains. What then
have I reserved to myself after all these labours, except
this purple robe and this diadem?<a name="FNanchor_872" id="FNanchor_872"></a><a href="#Footnote_872" class="fnanchor">872</a> I have appropriated
nothing myself, nor can any one point out my treasures,
except these possessions of yours or the things which I
am guarding on your behalf.<a name="FNanchor_873" id="FNanchor_873"></a><a href="#Footnote_873" class="fnanchor">873</a> Individually, however,
I have no motive to guard them, since I feed on the
same fare as you do, and I take only the same amount
of sleep. Nay, I do not think that my fare is as good
as that of those among you who live luxuriously; and I
know that I often sit up at night to watch for you, that
you may be able to sleep.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Alexander’s Speech</span> (<i>continued</i>).</p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">“But</span> some one may say, that while you endured toil and
fatigue, I have acquired these things as your leader
without myself sharing the toil and fatigue. But who
is there of you who knows that he has endured greater
toil for me than I have for him? Come now! whoever
of you has wounds, let him strip and show them, and
I will show mine in turn; for there is no part of my
body, in front at any rate, remaining free from wounds;
nor is there any kind of weapon used either for close
combat or for hurling at the enemy, the traces of which
I do not bear on my person. For I have been wounded
with the sword in close fight, I have been shot with
arrows, and I have been struck with missiles projected
from engines of war; and though oftentimes I have been
hit with stones and bolts of wood for the sake of your
lives, your glory, and your wealth, I am still leading you
as conquerors over all the land and sea, all rivers, mountains,
and plains. I have celebrated your weddings with
my own, and the children of many of you will be akin
to my children. Moreover I have liquidated the debts
of all those who had incurred them, without inquiring
too closely for what purpose they were contracted, though
you receive such high pay, and carry off so much booty
whenever there is booty to be got after a siege. Most
of you have golden crowns, the eternal memorials of your
valour and of the honour you receive from me. Whoever
has been killed, has met with a glorious end and
has been honoured with a splendid burial. Brazen
statues of most of the slain have been erected at home,<a name="FNanchor_874" id="FNanchor_874"></a><a href="#Footnote_874" class="fnanchor">874</a>
and their parents are held in honour, being released from
all public service and from taxation. But no one of you
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">387</a></span>has ever been killed in flight under my leadership. And
now I was intending to send back those of you who are
unfit for service, objects of envy to those at home; but
since you all wish to depart, depart all of you! Go back
and report at home that your king Alexander, the conqueror
of the Persians, Medes, Bactrians, and Sacians<a name="FNanchor_875" id="FNanchor_875"></a><a href="#Footnote_875" class="fnanchor">875</a>;
the man who has subjugated the Uxians, Arachotians,
and Drangians; who has also acquired the rule of the
Parthians, Chorasmians, and Hyrcanians, as far as the
Caspian Sea; who has marched over the Caucasus,
through the Caspian Gates; who has crossed the rivers
Oxus and Tanais, and the Indus besides, which has never
been crossed by any one else except Dionysus; who has
also crossed the Hydaspes, Acesines, and Hydraotes,
and who would have crossed the Hyphasis, if you had
not shrunk back with alarm; who has penetrated into
the Great Sea by both the mouths of the Indus; who has
marched through the desert of Gadrosia, where no one
ever before marched with an army; who on his route
acquired possession of Carmania and the land of the
Oritians, in addition to his other conquests, his fleet
having in the meantime already sailed round the coast
of the sea which extends from India to Persia&mdash;report
that when you returned to Susa you deserted him and
went away, handing him over to the protection of conquered

<h3>CHAPTER XI.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Reconciliation between Alexander and his Army.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Having</span> thus spoken, he leaped down quickly from the
platform, and entered the palace, where he paid no atten<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">388</a></span>tion
to the decoration of his person, nor was any of his
Companions admitted to see him. Not even on the
morrow was any one of them admitted to an audience;
but on the third day he summoned the select Persians
within, and among them he distributed the commands
of the brigades, and made the rule that only those whom
he had proclaimed his kinsmen,<a name="FNanchor_876" id="FNanchor_876"></a><a href="#Footnote_876" class="fnanchor">876</a> should have the honour
of saluting him with a kiss.<a name="FNanchor_877" id="FNanchor_877"></a><a href="#Footnote_877" class="fnanchor">877</a> But the Macedonians who
heard the speech were thoroughly astonished at the moment,
and remained there in silence near the platform;
nor when he retired did any of them accompany the king,
except his personal Companions and the confidential
body-guards. Though they remained, most of them had
nothing to do or say; and yet they were unwilling to
retire. But when the news was reported to them about
the Persians and Medes, that the military commands were
being given to Persians, that the foreign soldiers were
being selected and divided into companies, that a Persian
foot-guard, Persian foot Companions, a Persian regiment
of men with silver shields,<a name="FNanchor_878" id="FNanchor_878"></a><a href="#Footnote_878" class="fnanchor">878</a> as well as the cavalry Companions,
and another royal regiment of cavalry distinct
from these, were being called by Macedonian names, they
were no longer able to restrain themselves; but running
in a body to the palace, they cast their weapons there
in front of the gates as a sign of supplication to the
king. Standing in front of the gates, they shouted, beseeching
to be allowed to enter, and saying that they
were willing to surrender the men who had been the instigators
of the disturbance on that occasion, and those who
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">389</a></span>had begun the clamour. They also declared they would
not retire from the gates either day or night, unless
Alexander would take some pity upon them. When he
was informed of this, he came out without delay; and
seeing them lying on the ground in humble guise, and
hearing most of them lamenting with loud voice, tears
began to flow also from his own eyes. He made an
effort to say something to them, but they continued their
importunate entreaties.<a name="FNanchor_879" id="FNanchor_879"></a><a href="#Footnote_879" class="fnanchor">879</a> At length one of them, Callines
by name, a man conspicuous both for his age and because
he was captain of the Companion cavalry, spoke as
follows:&mdash;“O king, what grieves the Macedonians is,
that thou hast already made some of the Persians
kinsmen to thyself, and that Persians are called Alexander’s
kinsmen, and have the honour of saluting thee
with a kiss; whereas none of the Macedonians have
as yet enjoyed this honour.” Then Alexander interrupting
him, said:&mdash;“But all of you without exception
I consider my kinsmen, and so from this time I shall
call you.” When he had said this, Callines advanced
and saluted him with a kiss, and so did all those who
wished to salute him. Then they took up their weapons
and returned to the camp, shouting and singing a song
of thanksgiving to Apollo. After this Alexander offered
sacrifice to the gods to whom it was his custom to
sacrifice, and gave a public banquet, over which he himself
presided, with the Macedonians sitting around him;
and next to them the Persians; after whom came the
men of the other nations, honoured for their personal
rank or for some meritorious action. The king and his
guests drew wine from the same bowl and poured out
the same libations, both the Grecian prophets and the
Magians commencing the ceremony. He prayed for
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">390</a></span>other blessings, and especially that harmony and community
of rule might exist between the Macedonians
and Persians. The common account is, that those who
took part in this banquet were 9,000 in number, that all
of them poured out one libation, and after it sang a song
of thanksgiving to Apollo.<a name="FNanchor_880" id="FNanchor_880"></a><a href="#Footnote_880" class="fnanchor">880</a></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Ten Thousand Macedonians Sent Home with Craterus.&mdash;Disputes

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Then</span> those of the Macedonians who were unfit for service
on account of age or any other misfortune, went back of
their own accord, to the number of about 10,000. To
these Alexander gave the pay not only for the time which
had already elapsed, but also for that which they
would spend in returning home. He also gave to each
man a talent in addition to his pay.<a name="FNanchor_881" id="FNanchor_881"></a><a href="#Footnote_881" class="fnanchor">881</a> If any of them had
children by Asiatic wives, he ordered them to leave them
behind with him, lest they should introduce into Macedonia
a cause of discord, taking with them children by
foreign women who were of a different race from the
children whom they had left behind at home born of
Macedonian mothers. He promised to take care that they
should be brought up as Macedonians, educating them
not only in general matters but also in the art of war.
He also undertook to lead them into Macedonia when
they arrived at manhood, and hand them over to their
fathers. These uncertain and obscure promises were made
to them as they were departing; and he thought he was
giving a most indubitable proof of the friendship and
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">391</a></span>affection he had for them by sending with them, as their
guardian and the leader of the expedition, Craterus, the
man most faithful to him, and whom he valued equally
with himself.<a name="FNanchor_882" id="FNanchor_882"></a><a href="#Footnote_882" class="fnanchor">882</a> Then, having saluted them all, he with
tears dismissed them likewise weeping from his presence.
He ordered Craterus<a name="FNanchor_883" id="FNanchor_883"></a><a href="#Footnote_883" class="fnanchor">883</a> to lead these men back, and when
he had done so, to take upon himself the government of
Macedonia, Thrace, and Thessaly, and to preside over the
freedom of the Greeks. He also ordered Antipater to
bring to him the Macedonians of manly age as successors
to those who were being sent back. He despatched
Polysperchon also with Craterus, as his second in command,
so that if any mishap befell Craterus on the march
(for he was sending him back on account of the weakness
of his health), those who were going might not be in need
of a general.<a name="FNanchor_884" id="FNanchor_884"></a><a href="#Footnote_884" class="fnanchor">884</a> A secret report was also going about that
Alexander was now overcome by his mother’s accusations
of Antipater, and that he wished to remove him from
Macedonia.<a name="FNanchor_885" id="FNanchor_885"></a><a href="#Footnote_885" class="fnanchor">885</a> This report was current among those who
thought that royal actions are more worthy of honour in
proportion to their secrecy, and who were inclined to
impute what is worthy of belief to a bad motive rather
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">392</a></span>than to attribute it to the real one; a course to which
they were led by appearances and their own depravity.
But probably this sending for Antipater was not designed
for his dishonour, but rather to prevent any unpleasant
consequences to Antipater and Olympias from their quarrel
which he might not himself be able to rectify. For they
were incessantly writing to Alexander, the former saying
that the arrogance, acerbity, and meddlesomeness of
Olympias was exceedingly unbecoming to the king’s
mother; insomuch that Alexander was related to have
used the following remark in reference to the reports
which he received about his mother:&mdash;that she was exacting
from him a heavy house-rent for the ten months.<a name="FNanchor_886" id="FNanchor_886"></a><a href="#Footnote_886" class="fnanchor">886</a>
The queen wrote that Antipater was overweeningly insolent
in his pretensions and in the service of his court,
no longer remembering the one who had appointed him,
but claiming to win and hold the first rank<a name="FNanchor_887" id="FNanchor_887"></a><a href="#Footnote_887" class="fnanchor">887</a> among
the Macedonians and Greeks. These slanderous reports
about Antipater appeared to have more weight with Alexander,
since they were more formidable in regard to the
regal dignity. However no overt act or word of the king
was reported, from which any one could infer that Antipater
was in any way less in favour with him than
before.<a name="FNanchor_888" id="FNanchor_888"></a><a href="#Footnote_888" class="fnanchor">888</a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIII.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Nisaean Plain.&mdash;The Amazons.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">It</span> is said that Hephaestion much against his will yielded
to this argument and was reconciled to Eumenes, who on
his part wished to settle the dispute.<a name="FNanchor_889" id="FNanchor_889"></a><a href="#Footnote_889" class="fnanchor">889</a> In this journey<a name="FNanchor_890" id="FNanchor_890"></a><a href="#Footnote_890" class="fnanchor">890</a>
Alexander is said to have seen the plain which was
devoted to the royal mares. Herodotus says that the
plain itself was named Nisaean, and that the mares were
called Nisaean<a name="FNanchor_891" id="FNanchor_891"></a><a href="#Footnote_891" class="fnanchor">891</a>; adding that in olden times there were
150,000 of these horses. But at this time Alexander
found not many above 50,000; for most of them had been
carried off by robbers. They say that Atropates, the
viceroy of Media, gave him a hundred women, saying that
they were of the race of Amazons.<a name="FNanchor_892" id="FNanchor_892"></a><a href="#Footnote_892" class="fnanchor">892</a> These had been
equipped with the arms of male horsemen, except that
they carried axes instead of spears and targets instead of
shields. They also say that they had the right breast
smaller than the left, and that they exposed it in battle.
Alexander dismissed them from the army, that no attempt
to violate them might be made by the Macedonians or
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">394</a></span>barbarians; and he ordered them to carry word to their
queen that he was coming to her in order to procreate
children by her.<a name="FNanchor_893" id="FNanchor_893"></a><a href="#Footnote_893" class="fnanchor">893</a> But this story has been recorded
neither by Aristobulus nor Ptolemy, nor any other writer
who is a trustworthy authority on such matters. I do
not even think that the race of Amazons was surviving at
that time; for before Alexander’s time they were not
mentioned even by Xenophon,<a name="FNanchor_894" id="FNanchor_894"></a><a href="#Footnote_894" class="fnanchor">894</a> who mentions the Phasians,
Colchians, and all the other barbaric races which the
Greeks came upon, when they started from Trapezus or
before they marched down to Trapezus. They would certainly
have fallen in with the Amazons if they were still
in existence. However it does not seem to me credible
that this race of women was altogether fictitious, because
it has been celebrated by so many famous poets. For
the general account is, that Heracles marched against
them and brought the girdle of their queen Hippolyte
into Greece.<a name="FNanchor_895" id="FNanchor_895"></a><a href="#Footnote_895" class="fnanchor">895</a> The Athenians also under Theseus were
the first to conquer and repulse these women as they were
advancing into Europe<a name="FNanchor_896" id="FNanchor_896"></a><a href="#Footnote_896" class="fnanchor">896</a>; and the battle of the Athenians
and Amazons has been painted by Micon,<a name="FNanchor_897" id="FNanchor_897"></a><a href="#Footnote_897" class="fnanchor">897</a> no less than
that of the Athenians and Persians. Herodotus also has
frequently written about these women<a name="FNanchor_898" id="FNanchor_898"></a><a href="#Footnote_898" class="fnanchor">898</a>; and so have
the Athenian writers who have honoured the men who
perished in war with funeral orations. They have men<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">395</a></span>tioned
the exploit of the Athenians against the Amazons
as one of their special glories.<a name="FNanchor_899" id="FNanchor_899"></a><a href="#Footnote_899" class="fnanchor">899</a> If therefore Atropates
showed any equestrian women to Alexander, I think he
must have shown him some other foreign women trained
in horsemanship, and equipped with the arms which were
said to be those of the Amazons.<a name="FNanchor_900" id="FNanchor_900"></a><a href="#Footnote_900" class="fnanchor">900</a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIV.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Death of Hephaestion.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">In</span> Ecbatana Alexander offered sacrifice according to his
custom, for good fortune; and he celebrated a gymnastic
and musical contest. He also held drinking parties with
his Companions. At this time Hephaestion fell sick;
and they say that the stadium was full of people on the
seventh day of his fever, for on that day there was a
gymnastic contest for boys. When Alexander was informed
that Hephaestion was in a critical state, he went
to him without delay, but found him no longer alive.<a name="FNanchor_901" id="FNanchor_901"></a><a href="#Footnote_901" class="fnanchor">901</a>
Different authors have given different accounts of Alexander’s
grief on this occasion; but they agree in this,
that his grief was great. As to what was done in honour
of Hephaestion, they make diverse statements, just as
each writer was actuated by good-will or envy towards
him, or even towards Alexander himself. Of the authors
who have made these reckless statements, some seem to
me to have thought that whatever Alexander said or did
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">396</a></span>to show his excessive grief for the man who was the
dearest to him in the world, redounds to his own honour;
whereas others seem to have thought that it rather tended
to his disgrace, as being conduct unbecoming to any king
and especially to Alexander. Some say that he lay prostrate
on his companion’s body for the greater part of that
day, bewailing him and refusing to depart from him, until
he was forcibly carried away by his Companions. Others
that he lay upon the body the whole day and night.
Others again say that he hanged the physician Glaucias,
for having indiscreetly given the medicine<a name="FNanchor_902" id="FNanchor_902"></a><a href="#Footnote_902" class="fnanchor">902</a>; while others
affirm that he, being a spectator of the games, neglected
Hephaestion, who was filled with wine. That Alexander
should have cut off his hair in honour of the dead man,
I do not think improbable, both for other reasons and
especially from a desire to imitate Achilles, whom from
his boyhood he had an ambition to rival.<a name="FNanchor_903" id="FNanchor_903"></a><a href="#Footnote_903" class="fnanchor">903</a> Others also
say that Alexander himself at one time drove the chariot
on which the body was borne; but this statement I by
no means believe. Others again affirm that he ordered
the shrine of Asclepius in Ecbatana to be razed to the
ground; which was an act of barbarism, and by no means
in harmony with Alexander’s general behaviour, but
rather in accordance with the arrogance of Xerxes in his
dealings with the deity, who is said to have let fetters
down into the Hellespont, in order to punish it forsooth.<a name="FNanchor_904" id="FNanchor_904"></a><a href="#Footnote_904" class="fnanchor">904</a>
But the following statement, which has been recorded,
does not seem to me entirely beyond the range of probability:&mdash;that
when Alexander was marching to Babylon,
he was met on the road by many embassies from Greece,
among which were some Epidaurian envoys, who obtained
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">397</a></span>from him their requests.<a name="FNanchor_905" id="FNanchor_905"></a><a href="#Footnote_905" class="fnanchor">905</a> He also gave them an offering
to be conveyed to Asclepius, adding this remark:&mdash;“Although
Asclepius has not treated me fairly, in not saving
the life of my Companion, whom I valued equally with
my own head.”<a name="FNanchor_906" id="FNanchor_906"></a><a href="#Footnote_906" class="fnanchor">906</a> It has been stated by most writers
that he ordered honours to be always paid to Hephaestion
as a hero; and some say that he even sent men to Ammon’s
temple to ask the god if it were allowable to offer
sacrifice to Hephaestion as a god; but Ammon replied
that it was not allowable. All the authorities, however,
agree as to the following facts:&mdash;that until the third day
after Hephaestion’s death, Alexander neither tasted food
nor paid any attention to his personal appearance, but lay
on the ground either bewailing or silently mourning;
that he also ordered a funeral pyre to be prepared for
him in Babylon at the expense of 10,000 talents; some
say at a still greater cost<a name="FNanchor_907" id="FNanchor_907"></a><a href="#Footnote_907" class="fnanchor">907</a>; that a decree was published
throughout all the barbarian territory for the observance
of a public mourning.<a name="FNanchor_908" id="FNanchor_908"></a><a href="#Footnote_908" class="fnanchor">908</a> Many of Alexander’s Companions
dedicated themselves and their arms to the dead Hephaestion
in order to show their respect to him; and the first
to begin the artifice was Eumenes, whom we a short time
ago mentioned as having been at variance with him.<a name="FNanchor_909" id="FNanchor_909"></a><a href="#Footnote_909" class="fnanchor">909</a>
This he did that Alexander might not think he was
pleased at Hephaestion’s death. Alexander did not
appoint any one else to be commander of the Companion
cavalry in the place of Hephaestion, so that the name of
that general might not perish from the brigade; but that
division of cavalry was still called Hephaestion’s and the
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">398</a></span>figure made from Hephaestion went in front of it. He
also resolved to celebrate a gymnastic and musical contest,
much more magnificent than any of the preceding,
both in the multitude of competitors and in the amount
of money expended upon it. For he provided 3,000
competitors in all; and it is said that these men a short
time after also competed in the games held at Alexander’s
own funeral.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XV.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Subjugation of the Cossaeans.&mdash;Embassies from Distant
Nations.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">The</span> mourning was prolonged for many days; and as he
was now beginning to recall himself from it, under such
circumstances his Companions had less difficulty in
rousing him to action. Then at length he made an
expedition against the Cossaeans,<a name="FNanchor_910" id="FNanchor_910"></a><a href="#Footnote_910" class="fnanchor">910</a> a warlike race bordering
on the territory of the Uxians. They are mountaineers,
inhabiting strong positions in separate villages.
Whenever a force approached them, they were in the
habit of retiring to the summits of their mountains,
either in a body or separately as each man found it
practicable; and thus they escaped, making it difficult
for those who attacked them with their forces to come
near them. After the enemy’s departure, they used to
turn themselves again to marauding, by which occupation
they supported themselves. But Alexander subdued
this race, though he marched against them in the
winter; for neither winter nor ruggedness of ground
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">399</a></span>was any impediment either to him or to Ptolemy, son of
Lagus, who led a part of the army in the campaign
against them. Thus no military enterprise which
Alexander undertook was ever unsuccessful. As he was
marching back to Babylon, he was met by embassies
from the Libyans, who congratulated him and crowned
him as conqueror of the kingdom of Asia.<a name="FNanchor_911" id="FNanchor_911"></a><a href="#Footnote_911" class="fnanchor">911</a> From Italy
also came Bruttians, Lucanians, and Tyrrhenians<a name="FNanchor_912" id="FNanchor_912"></a><a href="#Footnote_912" class="fnanchor">912</a> as
envoys, for the same purpose. The Carthaginians are
said to have sent an embassy to him at this time<a name="FNanchor_913" id="FNanchor_913"></a><a href="#Footnote_913" class="fnanchor">913</a>; and it
is also asserted that envoys came to request his friendship
from the Ethiopians, the Scythians of Europe, the Gauls,
and Iberians&mdash;nations whose names were heard and their
accoutrements seen then for the first time by Greeks and
Macedonians. They are also said to have entrusted to
Alexander the duty of settling their disputes with each
other. Then indeed it was especially evident both to
himself and to those about him that he was lord of all
the land and sea.<a name="FNanchor_914" id="FNanchor_914"></a><a href="#Footnote_914" class="fnanchor">914</a> Of the men who have written the
history of Alexander, Aristus and Asclepiades<a name="FNanchor_915" id="FNanchor_915"></a><a href="#Footnote_915" class="fnanchor">915</a> alone say
that the Romans also sent an embassy to him, and that
when he met their embassy, he predicted something of
the future power of Rome, observing both the attire of
the men, their love of labour, and their devotion to
freedom. At the same time he made urgent inquiries
about their political constitution. This incident I have
recorded neither as certainly authentic nor as altogether
incredible; but none of the Roman writers have made
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">400</a></span>any mention of this embassy having been despatched to
Alexander; nor of those who have written an account of
Alexander’s actions, has either Ptolemy, son of Lagus,
or Aristobulus mentioned it. With these authors I am
generally inclined to agree. Nor does it seem likely that
the Roman republic, which was at that time remarkable
for its love of liberty, would send an embassy to a
foreign king, especially to a place so far away from their
own land, when they were not compelled to do so by
fear or any hope of advantage, being possessed as they
were beyond any other people by hatred to the very
name and race of despots.<a name="FNanchor_916" id="FNanchor_916"></a><a href="#Footnote_916" class="fnanchor">916</a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVI.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Exploration of the Caspian.&mdash;The Chaldaean Soothsayers.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">After</span> this, Alexander sent Heraclides, son of Argaeus,
into Hyrcania in command of a company of shipwrights,
with orders to cut timber from the Hyrcanian mountains
and with it to construct a number of ships of war, some
without decks and others with decks after the Grecian
fashion of ship-building.<a name="FNanchor_917" id="FNanchor_917"></a><a href="#Footnote_917" class="fnanchor">917</a> For he was very desirous of
discovering with what sea the one called the Hyrcanian or
Caspian unites; whether it communicates with the water
of the Euxine Sea, or whether the Great Sea comes right
round from the Eastern Sea, which is near India and
flows up into the Hyrcanian Gulf; just as he had
discovered that the Persian Sea, which was called the
Red Sea, is really a gulf of the Great Sea.<a name="FNanchor_918" id="FNanchor_918"></a><a href="#Footnote_918" class="fnanchor">918</a> For the
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">401</a></span>sources of the Caspian Sea had not yet been discovered,
although many nations dwell around it, and navigable
rivers discharge their waters into it. From Bactria, the
Oxus, the largest of Asiatic rivers, those of India
excepted, discharges itself into this sea<a name="FNanchor_919" id="FNanchor_919"></a><a href="#Footnote_919" class="fnanchor">919</a>; and through
Scythia flows the Jaxartes.<a name="FNanchor_920" id="FNanchor_920"></a><a href="#Footnote_920" class="fnanchor">920</a> The general account is, that
the Araxes also, which flows from Armenia, falls into the
same sea.<a name="FNanchor_921" id="FNanchor_921"></a><a href="#Footnote_921" class="fnanchor">921</a> These are the largest; but many others flow
into these, while others again discharge themselves
directly into this sea. Some of these were known to
those who visited these nations with Alexander; others
are situated towards the farther side of the gulf, as it
seems, in the country of the Nomadic Scythians, a
district which is quite unknown.</p>

<p>When Alexander had crossed the river Tigres with his
army and was marching to Babylon, he was met by the
Chaldaean philosophers<a name="FNanchor_922" id="FNanchor_922"></a><a href="#Footnote_922" class="fnanchor">922</a>; who, having led him away from
his Companions, besought him to suspend his march to
that city. For they said that an oracular declaration had
been made to them by the god Belus, that his entrance
into Babylon at that time would not be for his good.
But he answered their speech with a line from the poet
Euripides to this effect: “He the best prophet is that
guesses well.”<a name="FNanchor_923" id="FNanchor_923"></a><a href="#Footnote_923" class="fnanchor">923</a> But said the Chaldaeans:&mdash;“O king, do
not at any rate enter the city looking towards the west,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">402</a></span>nor leading the army advancing in that direction; but
rather go right round towards the east.” But this
did not turn out to be easy for him, on account of the
difficulty of the ground; for the deity was leading him
to the place where entering he was doomed soon to die.
And perhaps it was better for him to be taken off in the
very acme of his glory as well as of the affection
entertained for him by men, before any of the vicissitudes
natural to man befell him. Probably this was the
reason Solon advised Croesus to look at the end of a
long life, and not before pronounce any man happy.<a name="FNanchor_924" id="FNanchor_924"></a><a href="#Footnote_924" class="fnanchor">924</a>
Yea indeed, Hephaestion’s death had been no small
misfortune to Alexander; and I think he would rather
have departed before it occurred than have been alive to
experience it; no less than Achilles, as it seems to me,
would rather have died before Patroclus than have been
the avenger of his death.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER XVII.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Advice of the Chaldees Rejected.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">But</span> he had a suspicion that the Chaldaeans were trying
to prevent his entrance into Babylon at that time with
reference rather to their own advantage than to the
declaration of the oracle. For in the middle of the city
of the Babylonians was the temple of Belus,<a name="FNanchor_925" id="FNanchor_925"></a><a href="#Footnote_925" class="fnanchor">925</a> an edifice
very great in size, constructed of baked bricks which
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">403</a></span>were cemented together with bitumen. This temple had
been razed to the ground by Xerxes, when he returned
from Greece; as were also all the other sacred buildings
of the Babylonians. Some say that Alexander had
formed the resolution to rebuild it upon the former
foundations; and for this reason he ordered the Babylonians
to carry away the mound. Others say that he
intended to build a still larger one than that which
formerly existed.<a name="FNanchor_926" id="FNanchor_926"></a><a href="#Footnote_926" class="fnanchor">926</a> But after his departure, the men who
had been entrusted with the work prosecuted it without
any vigour, so that he determined to employ the whole of
his army in completing it. A great quantity of land as
well as gold had been dedicated to the god Belus by the
Assyrian kings; and in olden times the temple was kept
in repair and sacrifices were offered to the god. But at
that time the Chaldaeans were appropriating the property
of the god, since nothing existed upon which the
revenues could be expended. Alexander suspected that
they did not wish him to enter Babylon for this reason,
for fear that in a short time the temple would be
finished, and they should be deprived of the gains
accruing from the money. And yet, according to
Aristobulus, he was willing to yield to their persuasions
so far at least as to change the direction of his entry
into the city. For this purpose, on the first day he
encamped near the river Euphrates; and on the next
day he marched along the bank, keeping the river on
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">404</a></span>his right hand, with the intention of passing beyond the
part of the city turned towards the west, and there
wheeling round to lead his army towards the east. But
on account of the difficulty of the ground he could not
march with his army in this direction; because if a man
who is entering the city from the west, here changes his
direction eastward, he comes upon ground covered with
marshes and shoals. Thus, partly by his own will and
partly against his will, he disobeyed the god.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVIII.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Predictions of Alexander’s Death.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Moreover</span> Aristobulus has recorded the following story.
Apollodorus the Amphipolitan, one of Alexander’s
Companions, was general of the army which the king
left with Mazaeus, the viceroy of Babylon.<a name="FNanchor_927" id="FNanchor_927"></a><a href="#Footnote_927" class="fnanchor">927</a> When he
joined his forces with the king’s on the return of the
latter from India, and observed that he was severely
punishing the viceroys who had been placed over the
several countries, he sent to his brother Peithagoras
and asked him to divine about his safety. For
Peithagoras was a diviner who derived his knowledge
of the future from the inspection of the inward parts
of animals. This man sent back to Apollodorus, inquiring
of whom he was so especially afraid, as to wish
to consult divination. The latter wrote back: “The king
himself and Hephaestion.” Peithagoras therefore in the
first place offered sacrifice with reference to Hephaestion.
But as there was no lobe visible upon the liver of the
sacrificial victim,<a name="FNanchor_928" id="FNanchor_928"></a><a href="#Footnote_928" class="fnanchor">928</a> he stated this fact in a letter, which he
sealed and sent to his brother from Babylon to Ecbatana,
explaining that there was no reason at all to be afraid
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">405</a></span>of Hephaestion, for in a short time he would be out
of their way. And Aristobulus says that Apollodorus
received this epistle only one day before Hephaestion
died. Then Peithagoras again offered sacrifice in respect
to Alexander, and the liver of the victim consulted in
respect to him was also destitute of a lobe. He therefore
wrote to Apollodorus to the same purport about Alexander
as about Hephaestion. Apollodorus did not
conceal the information sent to him, but told Alexander,
in order the more to show his good-will to the king,
if he urged him to be on his guard lest some danger
might befall him at that time. And Aristobulus says that
the king commended Apollodorus, and when he entered
Babylon, he asked Peithagoras what sign he had met
with, to induce him to write thus to his brother. He
said that the liver of the victim sacrificed for him was
without a lobe. When Alexander asked what the sign
portended, he said that it was a very disastrous one.
The king was so far from being angry with him, that he
even treated him with greater respect, for telling him the
truth without any disguise. Aristobulus says that he
himself heard this story from Peithagoras; and adds
that the same man acted as diviner for Perdiccas and
afterwards for Antigonus, and that the same sign
occurred for both. It was verified by fact; for Perdiccas
lost his life leading an army against Ptolemy,<a name="FNanchor_929" id="FNanchor_929"></a><a href="#Footnote_929" class="fnanchor">929</a> and
Antigonus was killed in the battle fought by him at
Ipsus against Seleucus and Lysimachus.<a name="FNanchor_930" id="FNanchor_930"></a><a href="#Footnote_930" class="fnanchor">930</a> Also concerning
Calanus, the Indian philosopher, the following story
has been recorded. When he was going to the funeral
pyre to die, he gave the parting salutation to all his other
companions; but he refused to approach Alexander to
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">406</a></span>give him the salutation, saying he would meet him at
Babylon and there salute him. At the time indeed this
remark was treated with neglect; but afterwards, when
Alexander had died at Babylon, it came to the recollection
of those who had heard it, and they thought forsooth
that it was a divine intimation of Alexander’s approaching
end.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER XIX.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Embassies from Greece.&mdash;Fleet prepared for Invading
Arabia.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">As</span> he was entering Babylon, he was met by embassies
from the Greeks; but for what purpose each embassy was
sent has not been recorded.<a name="FNanchor_931" id="FNanchor_931"></a><a href="#Footnote_931" class="fnanchor">931</a> To me indeed it seems
probable that most of them came to crown and eulogize
him on account of his victories, especially the Indian
ones, as well as to say that the Greeks rejoiced at his
safe return from India. It is said that he greeted these
men with the right hand, and after paying them suitable
honour sent them back. He also gave the ambassadors
permission to take with them all the statues of men and
images of gods and the other votive offerings which
Xerxes had carried off from Greece to Babylon,
Pasargadae, Susa, or any other place in Asia. In this
way it is said that the brazen statues of Harmodius and
Aristogeiton,<a name="FNanchor_932" id="FNanchor_932"></a><a href="#Footnote_932" class="fnanchor">932</a> as well as the monument of the Celcaean
Artemis, were carried back to Athens.<a name="FNanchor_933" id="FNanchor_933"></a><a href="#Footnote_933" class="fnanchor">933</a></p>

<p>Aristobulus says that he found at Babylon the fleet with
Nearchus, which had sailed from the Persian Sea up the
river Euphrates; and another which had been conveyed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">407</a></span>from Phoenicia, consisting of two Phoenician quinqueremes,
three quadriremes, twelve triremes, and thirty triacontors.
These had been taken to pieces and conveyed
to the river Euphrates from Phoenicia to the city of
Thapsacus. There they were joined together again and
sailed down to Babylon. The same writer says that he
cut down the cypresses in Babylonia and with them built
another fleet; for in the land of the Assyrians these
trees alone are abundant, but of the other things necessary
for ship-building this country affords no supply.
A multitude of purple-fishers and other sea-faring men
came to him from Phoenicia and the rest of the seaboard
to serve as crews for the ships and perform the other
services on board. Near Babylon he made a harbour by
excavation large enough to afford anchorage to 1,000
ships of war; and adjoining the harbour he made dockyards.
Miccalus the Clazomenian<a name="FNanchor_934" id="FNanchor_934"></a><a href="#Footnote_934" class="fnanchor">934</a> was despatched to
Phoenicia and Syria with 500 talents<a name="FNanchor_935" id="FNanchor_935"></a><a href="#Footnote_935" class="fnanchor">935</a> to enlist some
men and to purchase others who were experienced in
nautical affairs. For Alexander designed to colonize the
seaboard near the Persian Gulf, as well as the islands in
that sea. For he thought that this land would become
no less prosperous than Phoenicia. He made these preparations
of the fleet to attack the main body of the
Arabs,<a name="FNanchor_936" id="FNanchor_936"></a><a href="#Footnote_936" class="fnanchor">936</a> under the pretext that they were the only barbarians
of this region who had not sent an embassy to
him or done anything else becoming their position and
showing respect to him. But the truth was, as it seems
to me, that Alexander was insatiably ambitious of acquiring
fresh territory.<a name="FNanchor_937" id="FNanchor_937"></a><a href="#Footnote_937" class="fnanchor">937</a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XX.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Description of Arabia.&mdash;Voyage of Nearchus.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">The</span> common report is, that he heard that the Arabs
venerated only two gods, Uranus and Dionysus<a name="FNanchor_938" id="FNanchor_938"></a><a href="#Footnote_938" class="fnanchor">938</a>; the
former because he is visible and contains in himself the
heavenly luminaries, especially the sun, from which
emanates the greatest and most evident benefit to all
things human; and the latter on account of the fame he
acquired by his expedition into India. Therefore he
thought himself quite worthy to be considered by the
Arabs as a third god, since he had performed deeds by
no means inferior to those of Dionysus. If then he
could conquer the Arabs, he intended to grant them the
privilege of conducting their government according to
their own customs, as he had already done to the Indians.
The fertility of the land was a secret inducement to him
to invade it; because he heard that the people obtained
cassia from the lakes, and myrrh and frankincense from
the trees; that cinnamon was cut from the shrubs, and
that the meadows produce spikenard without any cultivation.<a name="FNanchor_939" id="FNanchor_939"></a><a href="#Footnote_939" class="fnanchor">939</a>
As to the size of the country, he was informed that
the seaboard of Arabia was not less in extent than that of
India; that near it lie many islands; that in all parts of
the country there were harbours sufficiently commodious
to provide anchorage for his fleet, and that it supplied
sites for founding cities, which would become flourishing.
He was also informed that there were two islands in the
sea facing the mouth of the Euphrates, the first of which
was not far from the place where the waters of that river
are discharged into the sea, being about 120 stades<a name="FNanchor_940" id="FNanchor_940"></a><a href="#Footnote_940" class="fnanchor">940</a>
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">409</a></span>distant from the shore and the river’s mouth. This is
the smaller of the two, and was densely covered with
every kind of timber. In it was also a temple of Artemis,
around which the inhabitants themselves spent their
lives. The island was devoted to the use of wild goats
and stags, which were allowed to range at large as being
dedicated to Artemis. It was unlawful to chase them
unless any one wished to offer sacrifice to the goddess;
and for this purpose alone it was lawful to chase them.
Aristobulus says that Alexander ordered this island to
be called Icarus, after the island so named in the Aegean
Sea,<a name="FNanchor_941" id="FNanchor_941"></a><a href="#Footnote_941" class="fnanchor">941</a> on which, as the report goes, Icarus, son of Daedalus
fell, when the wax, by which the wings had been
fastened to him, melted. For he did not fly near the
earth, according to his father’s injunctions, but senselessly
flying far aloft, he allowed the sun to soften and
loosen the wax. Icarus left his name to the island and
the sea, the former being called Icarus and the latter the
Icarian. The other island was said to be distant from
the mouth of the Euphrates about a day and night’s
voyage for a ship running before the breeze. Its name
was Tylus<a name="FNanchor_942" id="FNanchor_942"></a><a href="#Footnote_942" class="fnanchor">942</a>; it was large and most of it neither rugged
nor woody, but suitable for producing cultivated fruits
and all things in due season. Some of this information
was imparted to Alexander by Archias, who was sent
with a triacontor to investigate the course of the coasting
voyage to Arabia, and who went as far as the island
of Tylus, but durst not pass beyond that point. Androsthenes<a name="FNanchor_943" id="FNanchor_943"></a><a href="#Footnote_943" class="fnanchor">943</a>
was despatched with another triacontor and
sailed to a part of the peninsula of Arabia. Hieron of
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">410</a></span>Soli the pilot also received a triacontor from Alexander
and advanced farthest of those whom he despatched to
this region; for he had received instructions to sail
round the whole Arabian peninsula as far as the Arabian
Gulf near Egypt over against Heroöpolis.<a name="FNanchor_944" id="FNanchor_944"></a><a href="#Footnote_944" class="fnanchor">944</a> Although he
coasted along the country of the Arabs to a great distance,
he durst not go as far as he was ordered; but returning
to Alexander he reported that the size of the
peninsula was marvellous, being only a little smaller
than the country of the Indians, and its extremity projected
far into the Great Sea.<a name="FNanchor_945" id="FNanchor_945"></a><a href="#Footnote_945" class="fnanchor">945</a> Nearchus indeed in his
voyage from India had seen this stretching out a little,
before he turned aside into the Persian Gulf, and he was
almost induced to cross over to it. The pilot Onesicritus
thought they ought to have gone thither; but Nearchus
says that he himself prevented it, so that after
sailing right round the Persian Gulf he might be able to
give a report to Alexander that he had accomplished the
voyage on which he had sent him. For Nearchus said
he had not been despatched to navigate the Great Sea,
but to explore the land bordering on the sea, to find out
what men inhabit it, to discover the harbours and rivers
in it, to ascertain the customs of the people, and to see
if any of the country was fertile and if any was sterile.
This was the reason why Alexander’s naval expedition
returned in safety; for if it had sailed beyond the deserts
of Arabia, it would not have returned in safety. This
is said also to have been the reason why Hieron turned
back.<a name="FNanchor_946" id="FNanchor_946"></a><a href="#Footnote_946" class="fnanchor">946</a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXI.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Description of the Euphrates and the Pallacopas.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">While</span> the triremes were being built for him, and the
harbour near Babylon was being excavated, Alexander
sailed from Babylon down the Euphrates to what was
called the river Pallacopas, which is distant from Babylon
about 800 stades.<a name="FNanchor_947" id="FNanchor_947"></a><a href="#Footnote_947" class="fnanchor">947</a> This Pallacopas is not a river rising
from springs, but a canal cut from the Euphrates. For
that river flowing from the Armenian mountains,<a name="FNanchor_948" id="FNanchor_948"></a><a href="#Footnote_948" class="fnanchor">948</a> proceeds
within its banks in the season of winter, because its
water is scanty; but when the spring begins to make its
appearance, and especially just before the summer solstice,
it pours along with mighty stream and overflows its banks
into the Assyrian country.<a name="FNanchor_949" id="FNanchor_949"></a><a href="#Footnote_949" class="fnanchor">949</a> For at that season the snow
upon the Armenian mountains melts and swells its water
to a great degree; and as its stream flows high above
the level of the country, it would flow over the land if
some one had not furnished it with an outlet along the
Pallacopas and turned it aside into the marshes and
pools, which, beginning from this canal, extend as far as
the country contiguous to Arabia. Thence it spreads
out far and wide into a shallow lake, from which it falls
into the sea by many invisible mouths. After the snow
has melted, about the time of the setting of the Pleiades,
the Euphrates flows with a small stream; but none
the less the greater part of it discharges itself into the
pools along the Pallacopas. Unless, therefore, some one
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">412</a></span>had dammed up the Pallacopas again, so that the water
might be turned back within the banks and carried down
the channel of the river, it would have drained the
Euphrates into itself, and consequently the Assyrian
country would not be watered by it. But the outlet of
the Euphrates into the Pallacopas was dammed up by
the viceroy of Babylonia with great labour (although it
was an easy matter to construct the outlet), because the
ground in this region is slimy and most of it mud, so
that when it has once received the water of the river it
is not easy to turn it back. But more than 10,000 Assyrians
were engaged in this labour even until the third
month. When Alexander was informed of this, he was
induced to confer a benefit upon the land of Assyria.
He determined to shut up the outlet where the stream
of the Euphrates was turned into the Pallacopas.
When he had advanced about thirty stades, the earth
appeared to be somewhat rocky, so that if it were cut
through and a junction made with the old canal along
the Pallacopas, on account of the hardness of the soil, it
would not allow the water to percolate, and there would
be no difficulty in turning it back at the appointed
season. For this purpose he sailed to the Pallacopas,
and then continued his voyage down that canal into the
pools towards the country of the Arabs. There seeing
a certain admirable site, he founded a city upon it and
fortified it. In it he settled as many of the Grecian
mercenaries as volunteered to remain, and such as were
unfit for military service by reason of age or wounds.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXII.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">An Omen of Alexander’s Approaching Death.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Having</span> thus proved the falsity of the prophecy of the
Chaldaeans, by not having experienced any unpleasant<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">413</a></span>
fortune in Babylon,<a name="FNanchor_950" id="FNanchor_950"></a><a href="#Footnote_950" class="fnanchor">950</a> as they had predicted, but having
marched out of that city without suffering any mishap,
be grew confident in spirit and sailed again through the
marshes, having Babylon on his left hand. Here a part
of his fleet lost its way in the narrow branches of the
river through want of a pilot, until he sent a man to
pilot it and lead it back into the channel of the river.
The following story is told. Most of the tombs of the
Assyrian kings had been built among the pools and
marshes.<a name="FNanchor_951" id="FNanchor_951"></a><a href="#Footnote_951" class="fnanchor">951</a> When Alexander was sailing through these
marshes, and, as the story goes, was himself steering the
trireme, a strong gust of wind fell upon his broad-brimmed
Macedonian hat, and the fillet which encircled
it. The hat, being heavy, fell into the water; but the
fillet, being carried along by the wind, was caught by one
of the reeds growing near the tomb of one of the ancient
kings.<a name="FNanchor_952" id="FNanchor_952"></a><a href="#Footnote_952" class="fnanchor">952</a> This incident itself was an omen of what was
about to occur, and so was the fact that one of the sailors<a name="FNanchor_953" id="FNanchor_953"></a><a href="#Footnote_953" class="fnanchor">953</a>
swam off towards the fillet and snatched it from the reed.
But he did not carry it in his hands, because it would
have been wetted while he was swimming; he therefore
put it round his own head and thus conveyed it to the
king. Most of the biographers of Alexander say that
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">414</a></span>the king presented him with a talent as a reward for his
zeal, and then ordered his head to be cut off; as the
prophets had directed him not to permit that head to
be safe which had worn the royal fillet. However, Aristobulus
says that the man received a talent; but afterwards
also received a scourging for placing the fillet
round his head. The same author says that it was one
of the Phoenician sailors who fetched the fillet for
Alexander; but there are some who say it was Seleucus,
and that this was an omen to Alexander of his death and
to Seleucus of his great kingdom. For that of all those
who succeeded to the sovereignty after Alexander,
Seleucus became the greatest king, was the most kingly
in mind, and ruled over the greatest extent of land after
Alexander himself, does not seem to me to admit of
question.<a name="FNanchor_954" id="FNanchor_954"></a><a href="#Footnote_954" class="fnanchor">954</a></p>

<hr />

<h3>CHAPTER XXIII.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Army Recruited from the Persians.&mdash;Hephaestion’s
Memory Honoured.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">When</span> he returned to Babylon he found that Peucestas
had arrived from Persis, bringing with him 20,000
Persians, as well as many Cossaeans and Tapurians,
because these races were reported to be the most warlike
of those bordering on Persis. Philoxenus also came to
him, bringing an army from Caria; Menander, with
another from Lydia, and Menidas with the cavalry which
had been put under his command.<a name="FNanchor_955" id="FNanchor_955"></a><a href="#Footnote_955" class="fnanchor">955</a> At the same time
arrived embassies from Greece, the members of which,
with crowns upon their own heads, approached Alexander
and crowned him with golden crowns, as if forsooth they
came to him as special envoys deputed to pay him divine
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">415</a></span>honours; and his end was not far off. Then he commended
the Persians for their great zeal towards him,
which was shown by their obedience to Peucestas in all
things, and Peucestas himself for the prudence which
he had displayed in ruling them. He distributed these
foreign soldiers among the Macedonian ranks in the following
way. Each company was led by a Macedonian
decurion, and next to him was a Macedonian receiving
double pay for distinguished valour; and then came one
who received ten staters,<a name="FNanchor_956" id="FNanchor_956"></a><a href="#Footnote_956" class="fnanchor">956</a> who was so named from the
pay he received, being less than that received by the
man with double pay, but more than that of the men
who were serving as soldiers without holding a position
of honour. Next to these came twelve Persians, and
last in the company another Macedonian, who also received
the pay of ten staters; so that in each company
there were twelve Persians and four Macedonians, three
of whom received higher pay, and the fourth was in
command of the company.<a name="FNanchor_957" id="FNanchor_957"></a><a href="#Footnote_957" class="fnanchor">957</a> The Macedonians were armed
in their hereditary manner; but of the Persians some
were archers, while others had javelins furnished with
straps, by which they were held.<a name="FNanchor_958" id="FNanchor_958"></a><a href="#Footnote_958" class="fnanchor">958</a> At this time Alexander
often reviewed his fleet, had many sham-fights with his
triremes and quadriremes in the river, and contests both
for rowers and pilots, the winners receiving crowns.</p>

<p>Now arrived the special envoys whom he had despatched
to Ammon to inquire how it was lawful for him to honour
Hephaestion. They told him that Ammon said it was
lawful to offer sacrifice to him as to a hero. Rejoicing at
the response of the oracle, he paid respect to him as a
hero from that time. He also despatched a letter to
Cleomenes, who was a bad man and had committed many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">416</a></span>acts of injustice in Egypt.<a name="FNanchor_959" id="FNanchor_959"></a><a href="#Footnote_959" class="fnanchor">959</a> For my own part I do not
blame him for his friendship to Hephaestion and for his
recollection of him even when dead; but I do blame him
for many other acts. For the letter commanded Cleomenes
to prepare chapels for the hero Hephaestion in the
Egyptian Alexandria, one in the city itself and another
in the island of Pharos, where the tower is situated.<a name="FNanchor_960" id="FNanchor_960"></a><a href="#Footnote_960" class="fnanchor">960</a>
The chapels were to be exceedingly large and to be
built at lavish expense. The letter also directed that
Cleomenes should take care that Hephaestion’s name
should be attached to them; and moreover that his
name should be engraved on all the legal documents with
which the merchants entered into bargains with each
other.<a name="FNanchor_961" id="FNanchor_961"></a><a href="#Footnote_961" class="fnanchor">961</a> These things I cannot blame, except that he
made so much ado about matters of trifling moment.
But the following I must blame severely: “If I find,”
said the letter, “the temples and chapels of the hero
Hephaestion in Egypt well completed, I will not only
pardon you any crimes you may have committed in the
past, but in the future you shall suffer no unpleasant
treatment from me, however great may be the crimes you
have committed.” I cannot commend this message sent
from a great king to a man who was ruling a large
country and many people, especially as the man was a
wicked one.<a name="FNanchor_962" id="FNanchor_962"></a><a href="#Footnote_962" class="fnanchor">962</a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIV.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Another Omen of Alexander’s Death.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">But</span> Alexander’s own end was now near. Aristobulus
says that the following occurrence was a prognostication
of what was about to happen. He was distributing the
army which came with Peucestas from Persia, and that
which came with Philoxenus and Menander from the sea,<a name="FNanchor_963" id="FNanchor_963"></a><a href="#Footnote_963" class="fnanchor">963</a>
among the Macedonian lines, and becoming thirsty he
retired from his seat and thus left the royal throne empty.
On each side of the throne were couches with silver feet,
upon which his personal Companions were sitting. A
certain man of obscure condition (some say that he was
even one of the men kept under guard without being in
chains), seeing the throne and the couches empty, and
the eunuchs standing round the throne (for the Companions
also rose up from their seats with the king when
he retired), walked through the line of eunuchs, ascended
the throne, and sat down upon it.<a name="FNanchor_964" id="FNanchor_964"></a><a href="#Footnote_964" class="fnanchor">964</a> According to a
Persian law, they did not make him rise from the throne;
but rent their garments and beat their breasts and faces
as if on account of a great evil.</p>

<p>When Alexander was informed of this, he ordered the
man who had sat upon his throne to be put to the torture,
with the view of discovering whether he had done this
according to a plan concerted by a conspiracy. But the
man confessed nothing, except that it came into his mind
at the time to act thus. Even more for this reason the
diviners explained that this occurrence boded no good to
him. A few days after this, after offering to the gods the
customary sacrifices for good success, and certain others
also for the purpose of divination, he was feasting with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">418</a></span>his friends, and was drinking far into the night.<a name="FNanchor_965" id="FNanchor_965"></a><a href="#Footnote_965" class="fnanchor">965</a> He is
also said to have distributed the sacrificial victims as well
as a quantity of wine to the army throughout the companies
and centuries. There are some who have recorded
that he wished to retire after the drinking party to his
bed-chamber; but Medius, at that time the most influential
of the Companions, met him and begged him to
join a party of revellers at his residence, saying that the
revel would be a pleasant one.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXV.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Alexander Seized with Fever.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">The</span> Royal Diary gives the following account,<a name="FNanchor_966" id="FNanchor_966"></a><a href="#Footnote_966" class="fnanchor">966</a> to the
effect that he revelled and drank at the dwelling of
Medius; then rose up, took a bath, and slept; then
again supped at the house of Medius and again drank
till far into the night. After retiring from the drinking
party he took a bath; after which he took a little food
and slept there, because he already felt feverish. He
was carried out upon a couch to the sacrifices, in order
that he might offer them according to his daily custom.
After performing the sacred rites he lay down in the
banqueting hall until dusk. In the meantime he gave
instructions to the officers about the expedition and
voyage, ordering those who were going on foot to be
ready on the fourth day, and those who were going to
sail with him to be ready to sail on the fifth day. From
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">419</a></span>this place he was carried upon the couch to the river,
where he embarked in a boat and sailed across the river
to the park. There he again took a bath and went to
rest.</p>

<p>On the following day he took another bath and offered
the customary sacrifices. He then entered a tester bed,
lay down, and chatted with Medius. He also ordered
his officers to meet him at daybreak. Having done this
he ate a little supper and was again conveyed into the
tester bed. The fever now raged the whole night without
intermission. The next day he took a bath; after which
he offered sacrifice, and gave orders to Nearchus and the
other officers that the voyage should begin on the third
day. The next day be bathed again and offered the
prescribed sacrifices. After performing the sacred rites,
he did not yet cease to suffer from the fever. Notwithstanding
this, he summoned the officers and gave them
instructions to have all things ready for the starting of
the fleet. In the evening he took a bath, after which he
was very ill. The next day he was transferred to the
house near the swimming-bath, where he offered the
prescribed sacrifices. Though he was now very dangerously
ill, he summoned the most responsible of his
officers and gave them fresh instructions about the
voyage. On the following day he was with difficulty
carried out to the sacrifices, which he offered; and none
the less gave other orders to the officers about the voyage.
The next day, though he was now very ill, he offered the
prescribed sacrifices. He now gave orders that the
generals should remain in attendance in the hall,<a name="FNanchor_967" id="FNanchor_967"></a><a href="#Footnote_967" class="fnanchor">967</a> and
that the colonels and captains should remain before the
gates. But being now altogether in a dangerous state,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">420</a></span>he was conveyed from the park into the palace. When
his officers entered the room, he knew them indeed, but
could no longer utter a word, being speechless. During
the ensuing night and day and the next night and day
he was in a very high fever.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER XXVI.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Alexander’s Death.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Such</span> is the account given in the Royal Diary. In addition
to this, it states that the soldiers were very desirous
of seeing him; some, in order to see him once more while
still alive; others, because there was a report that he was
already dead, imagined that his death was being concealed
by the confidential body-guards, as I for my part suppose.
Most of them through grief and affection for their king
forced their way in to see him. It is said that when his
soldiers passed by him he was unable to speak; yet he
greeted each of them with his right hand, raising his
head with difficulty and making a sign with his eyes.
The Royal Diary also says that Peithon, Attalus, Demophon,
and Peucestas, as well as Cleomenes, Menidas, and
Seleucus, slept in the temple of Serapis,<a name="FNanchor_968" id="FNanchor_968"></a><a href="#Footnote_968" class="fnanchor">968</a> and asked the
god whether it would be better and more desirable for
Alexander to be carried into his temple, in order as a
suppliant to be cured by him. A voice issued from the
god saying that he was not to be carried into the temple,
but that it would be better for him to remain where he
was. This answer was reported by the Companions; and
soon after Alexander died, as if forsooth this were now
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">421</a></span>the better thing. Neither Aristobulus nor Ptolemy has
given an account differing much from the preceding.
Some authors, however, have related that his Companions
asked him to whom he left his kingdom; and that he
replied: “To the best.”<a name="FNanchor_969" id="FNanchor_969"></a><a href="#Footnote_969" class="fnanchor">969</a> Others say, that in addition
to this remark, he told them that he saw there would be
a great funeral contest held in his honour.<a name="FNanchor_970" id="FNanchor_970"></a><a href="#Footnote_970" class="fnanchor">970</a></p>

<hr />

<h3>CHAPTER XXVII.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rumour that Alexander was Poisoned.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">I</span> am aware that many other particulars have been related
by historians concerning Alexander’s death, and especially
that poison was sent for him by Antipater, from the
effects of which he died.<a name="FNanchor_971" id="FNanchor_971"></a><a href="#Footnote_971" class="fnanchor">971</a> It is also asserted that the
poison was procured for Antipater by Aristotle, who was
now afraid of Alexander on account of Callisthenes.<a name="FNanchor_972" id="FNanchor_972"></a><a href="#Footnote_972" class="fnanchor">972</a> It
is said to have been conveyed by Cassander, the son of
Antipater,<a name="FNanchor_973" id="FNanchor_973"></a><a href="#Footnote_973" class="fnanchor">973</a> some recording that he conveyed it in the
hoof of a mule, and that his younger brother Iollas gave
it to the king.<a name="FNanchor_974" id="FNanchor_974"></a><a href="#Footnote_974" class="fnanchor">974</a> For this man was the royal cup-bearer,
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">422</a></span>and he happened to have received some affront from
Alexander a short time before his death. Others have
stated that Medius, being a lover of Iollas, took part in
the deed; for he it was who induced the king to hold the
revel. They say that Alexander was seized with an acute
paroxysm of pain over the wine-cup, on feeling which he
retired from the drinking bout.<a name="FNanchor_975" id="FNanchor_975"></a><a href="#Footnote_975" class="fnanchor">975</a> One writer has not
even been ashamed to record that when Alexander perceived
be was unlikely to survive, he was going out to
throw himself into the river Euphrates, so that he might
disappear from men’s sight, and leave among the men of
after-times a more firmly-rooted opinion that he owed his
birth to a god, and had departed to the gods. But as he
was going out he did not escape the notice of his wife
Roxana, who restrained him from carrying out his
design. Whereupon he uttered lamentations, saying that
she forsooth envied him the complete glory of being
thought the offspring of the god. These statements I
have recorded rather that I may not seem to be ignorant
that they have been made, than because I consider them
worthy of credence or even of narration.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Character of Alexander.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Alexander</span> died in the hundred and fourteenth Olympiad,
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">423</a></span>in the archonship of Hegesias at Athens.<a name="FNanchor_976" id="FNanchor_976"></a><a href="#Footnote_976" class="fnanchor">976</a> According to
the statement of Aristobulus, he lived thirty-two years,
and had reached the eighth month of his thirty-third
year. He had reigned twelve years and these eight
months.<a name="FNanchor_977" id="FNanchor_977"></a><a href="#Footnote_977" class="fnanchor">977</a> He was very handsome in person, and much
devoted to exertion, very active in mind, very heroic in
courage, very tenacious of honour, exceedingly fond of
incurring danger, and strictly observant of his duty to
the gods. In regard to the pleasures of the body, he had
perfect self-control; and of those of the mind, praise was
the only one of which he was insatiable. He was very
clever in recognising what was necessary to be done,
even when it was still a matter unnoticed by others; and
very successful in conjecturing from the observation of
facts what was likely to occur. In marshalling, arming,
and ruling an army, he was exceedingly skilful; and very
renowned for rousing the courage of his soldiers, filling
them with hopes of success, and dispelling their fear in
the midst of danger by his own freedom from fear.
Therefore even what he had to do in secret he did with
the greatest boldness. He was also very clever in getting
the start of his enemies, and snatching from them their
advantages by secretly forestalling them, before any one
even feared what was about to happen. He was likewise
very steadfast in keeping the agreements and settlements
which he made, as well as very secure from being
entrapped by deceivers. Finally, he was very sparing in
the expenditure of money for the gratification of his own
pleasures; but he was exceedingly bountiful in spending
it for the benefit of his associates.</p>

<hr />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">424</a></span></p><h3>CHAPTER XXIX.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Apology for Alexander’s Errors.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">That</span> Alexander should have committed errors in his
conduct from quickness of temper or from wrath,<a name="FNanchor_978" id="FNanchor_978"></a><a href="#Footnote_978" class="fnanchor">978</a> and
that he should have been induced to comport himself like
the Persian monarchs to an immoderate degree, I do not
think remarkable if we fairly consider both his youth<a name="FNanchor_979" id="FNanchor_979"></a><a href="#Footnote_979" class="fnanchor">979</a> and
his uninterrupted career of good fortune; likewise that
kings have no associates in pleasure who aim at their
best interests, but that they will always have associates
urging them to do wrong. However, I am certain that
Alexander was the only one of the ancient kings who,
from nobility of character, repented of the errors which
he had committed. The majority of men, even if they
have become conscious that they have committed an
error, make the mistake of thinking that they can conceal
their sin by defending their error as if it had been a just
action. But it seems to me that the only cure for sin is
for the sinner to confess it, and to be visibly repentant
in regard to it. Thus the suffering will not appear
altogether intolerable to those who have undergone unpleasant
treatment, if the person who inflicted it confesses
that he has acted dishonourably; and this good hope for
the future is left to the man himself, that he will never
again commit a similar sin, if he is seen to be vexed at
his former errors. I do not think that even his tracing
his origin to a god was a great error on Alexander’s part,
if it was not perhaps merely a device to induce his
subjects to show him reverence.<a name="FNanchor_980" id="FNanchor_980"></a><a href="#Footnote_980" class="fnanchor">980</a> Nor does he seem to
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">425</a></span>me to have been a less renowned king than Minos, Aeacus,
or Rhadamanthus, to whom no insolence is attributed by
the men of old, because they traced their origin to Zeus.
Nor does he seem at all inferior to Theseus or Ion, the
former being the reputed son of Poseidon, and the latter
of Apollo. His adoption of the Persian mode of dressing
also seems to me to have been a political device in regard
to the foreigners, that the king might not appear
altogether an alien to them; and in regard to the Macedonians,
to show them that he had a refuge from their
rashness of temper and insolence. For this reason I
think, he mixed the Persian royal guards, who carried
golden apples at the end of their spears,<a name="FNanchor_981" id="FNanchor_981"></a><a href="#Footnote_981" class="fnanchor">981</a> among the ranks
of the Macedonians, and the Persian peers<a name="FNanchor_982" id="FNanchor_982"></a><a href="#Footnote_982" class="fnanchor">982</a> with the
Macedonian body-guards. Aristobulus also asserts that
Alexander used to have long drinking parties, not for
the purpose of enjoying the wine, as he was not a great
wine-drinker, but in order to exhibit his sociality and
friendly feeling to his Companions.<a name="FNanchor_983" id="FNanchor_983"></a><a href="#Footnote_983" class="fnanchor">983</a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXX.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Eulogy of Alexander.</span></p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Whoever</span> therefore reproaches Alexander as a bad man,
let him do so; but let him first not only bring before his
mind all his actions deserving reproach, but also gather
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">426</a></span>into one view all his deeds of every kind. Then, indeed,
let him reflect who he is himself, and what kind of fortune
he has experienced; and then consider who that man was
whom he reproaches as bad, and to what a height of
human success he attained, becoming without any dispute
king of both continents,<a name="FNanchor_984" id="FNanchor_984"></a><a href="#Footnote_984" class="fnanchor">984</a> and reaching every place by his
fame; while he himself who reproaches him is of smaller
account, spending his labour on petty objects, which,
however, he does not succeed in effecting, petty as they
are. For my own part, I think there was at that time no
race of men, no city, nor even a single individual to whom
Alexander’s name and fame had not penetrated. For
this reason it seems to me that a hero totally unlike any
other human being could not have been born without the
agency of the deity. And this is said to have been
revealed after Alexander’s death by the oracular responses,
by the visions which presented themselves to various
people, and by the dreams which were seen by different
individuals. It is also shown by the honour paid to him
by men up to the present time, and by the recollection
which is still held of him as more than human. Even at
the present time, after so long an interval, other oracular
responses in his honour have been received by the nation
of the Macedonians. In relating the history of Alexander’s
achievements, there are some things which I have
been compelled to censure; but I am not ashamed to
admire Alexander himself. Those actions I have branded
as bad, both from a regard to my own veracity, and at
the same time for the benefit of mankind.<a name="FNanchor_985" id="FNanchor_985"></a><a href="#Footnote_985" class="fnanchor">985</a> For this
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">427</a></span>reason I think that I undertook the task of writing this
history not without the divine inspiration.</p>

as the Son of Lagus, a Macedonian of low birth. Ptolemy’s mother,
Arsinoe, had been a concubine of Philip of Macedon, for which reason
it was generally believed that Ptolemy was the offspring of that
king. Ptolemy was one of the earliest friends of Alexander before his
accession to the throne, and accompanied him throughout his campaigns,
being one of his most skilful generals and most intimate friends. On
the division of the empire after Alexander’s death, Ptolemy obtained
the kingdom of Egypt, which he transmitted to his descendants. After
a distinguished reign of thirty-eight years, he abdicated the throne
to his youngest son, Ptolemy Philadelphus. He survived this event two
years, and died <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 283. He was a liberal patron of literature and the
arts, and wrote a history of the wars of Alexander, which is one of
the chief authorities on which Arrian composed his narrative. For his
beneficence, see Aelian (<i>Varia Historia</i>, xiii. 12). Not only Arrian,
but Plutarch and Strabo, derived much information from Ptolemy’s work,
which is highly commended by Athenæus.</p></div>

called Cassandrea, served under Alexander, and wrote a history of his
wars, which, like that of Ptolemy, was sometimes more panegyrical
than the facts warranted. Neither of these histories has survived,
but they served Arrian as the groundwork for the composition of
his own narrative. Lucian in his treatise, <i>Quomodo historia sit
conscribenda</i>, ch. 12, accuses Aristobulus of inventing marvellous
tales of Alexander’s valour for the sake of flattery. Plutarch based
his <i>Life of Alexander</i> chiefly on the work of this writer. We learn
from Lucian (<i>Macrobioi</i>, c. 22), that Aristobulus wrote his history
at the advanced age of eighty-four. He was employed by Alexander to
superintend the restoration of Cyrus’s tomb (<i>Arrian</i>, vi. 30).</p></div>

who stabbed him at the festival which he was holding to celebrate
the marriage of his daughter with Alexander, king of Epirus. It was
suspected that both Olympias and her son Alexander were implicated in
the plot. At the time of his assassination Philip was just about to
start on an expedition against Persia, which his son afterwards so
successfully carried out. See Plutarch (<i>Alex.</i>, 10); <i>Diod.</i>, xix. 93,

tuition of Aristotle, who acquired very great influence over his
mind and character, and retained it until his pupil was spoiled by
his unparalleled successes. See Aelian (<i>Varia Historia</i>, xii. 54).
Such was his ability, that at the age of 16 he was entrusted with
the government of Macedonia by his father, when he marched against
Byzantium. At the age of 18 by his skill and courage he greatly
assisted Philip in gaining the battle of Chaeronea. When Philip was
murdered, Alexander ascended the throne, and after putting down
rebellion at home, he advanced into Greece to secure the power which
his father had acquired. See <i>Diod.</i>, xvi. 85; <i>Arrian</i>, vii. 9.</p></div>

sanguinary conflict between Alexander’s body-guard and the Persian
nobles, in which the Great King’s horses were wounded and became
unmanageable, whereupon Darius got out, mounted a horse, and fled.
We learn from Plutarch (<i>Alex.</i>, 20) that Chares affirmed Alexander
came into hand-to-hand conflict with Darius, and that he received
a wound in the thigh from that king’s sword. Plutarch says that
Alexander wrote to Antipater that he had been wounded in the thigh
with a dagger, but did not say by whom. He also wrote that nothing
serious had resulted from the wound. The account of Arrian is far the
most trustworthy. Callisthenes stated that Alexander made a direct
attack upon Darius (<i>Polybius</i>, xii. 22). We know from Xenophon that
the Persian kings were in the habit of occupying the centre, and that
Cyrus directed Clearchus to make the attack against the person of his
brother Artaxerxes at the battle of Cunaxa. Polybius seems to have
been ignorant of this custom of the Persian kings when he wrote his
criticism on the statement of Callisthenes.</p></div>

the mountains of Armenia. It unites with the Tigris, and after a course
of 1,780 miles flows into the Persian Gulf. It is navigable by boats
for 1,200 miles. The annual inundation, caused by the melting of the
snow in the mountains of Armenia, takes place in the month of May. The
Euphrates, Tigris, and Eulaeus had formerly three separate outlets into
the Persian Gulf; but the three now unite in a single stream, which is
called Shat-el-Arab. The Hebrew name for the river which the Greeks
called Euphrates, was Pĕrath (rapid stream). It is called in the Bible,
the <i>Great River</i>, and <i>the River</i> (Gen. xv. 18; Exod. xxiii. 31; <i>et
passim</i>). In Jeremiah xiii. 4-7, the word <i>Pĕrath</i> stands for Ephrath,

<p><a name="Footnote_275" id="Footnote_275"></a><a href="#FNanchor_275"><span class="label">275</span></a> The term <i>Cĕnaan</i> was applied to the lowland plain from Aradus
to Gaza. The northern portion, from Aradus to Carmel, is known to
us under its Grecian name of Phoenicia, which is probably derived
from the Greek <i>phoinix</i> (a palm-tree), which grew abundantly in the
country, and was the emblem of some of its towns. Others derive it from
another Greek word <i>phoinix</i> (red dye), which formed one of its most
important manufactures. The Phoenicians applied the term Cenaan to
their land in contrast to the highlands to the west, which they called
<i>Aram</i> (highland), the Hebrew name for Syria. The country of Phoenicia
was 120 miles long and with an average breadth of 12 miles, never
exceeding 20 miles. The chief cities of Phoenicia were Tyre, Sidon,
Aradus, Byblus, Berytus, Tripolis, and Accho or Ptolemais. Its central
position between the eastern and western countries, early developed
its commercial power, and its intercourse with foreign nations at an
early period produced an advanced state of civilization and refinement.
The Phoenicians were a Semitic nation like the Israelites; and their
language bears a remarkable affinity with the Hebrew, as is seen by
fragments of the Carthaginian language preserved in Plautus. In an
inscription discovered at Marseilles in 1845, out of 94 words 74
were found in the Hebrew Bible. The Phoenicians were asserted by the
Greeks to have communicated to them the knowledge of letters; and this
statement is corroborated by the similarity of the Hebrew and ancient
Greek letters. Their colonies spread from Cyprus to Crete and the
Cyclades, thence to Euboea, Greece, and Thrace. The coasts of Asia
Minor and Bithynia were dotted with their settlements, and they carried
their commerce into the Black Sea. They also had colonies in Sicily,
Sardinia, Ivica, and Spain, where they founded Cadiz. The northern
coast of Africa was lined with their colonies, the most flourishing of
which was Carthage, which rose to be one of the great powers of the
world. Strabo says that they had 300 colonies on the western coast of
Africa. They visited the coasts of England for tin; and thus, to quote
the words of Humboldt, “the Tyrian flag waved at the same time in
Britain and the Indian Ocean.” <i>Herodotus</i> (iv. 42, 43) says that under
the patronage of Necho, king of Egypt, they circumnavigated Africa; but
he states that he does not believe it was a fact. The reason which he
assigns for his disbelief is, that the navigators alleged that the sun
was on their right hand, which is the strongest argument in favour of
the truth of their statement. In Isaiah xxiii. 11, Phoenicia is called
Cĕnaan, where the English Bible has erroneously, <i>the merchant city</i>.
In the Bible the word <i>Cĕnaanim</i> is frequently used for <i>merchants</i>,
because the Phoenicians were the principal commercial people of
antiquity (Job xli. 6; Prov. xxxi. 24; Isaiah xxiii. 8; Hos. xii.
7; Zeph. i. 2; Zech. xiv. 21). Tripolis consisted of three distinct
cities, 600 feet apart, each having its own walls, but all united in
a common constitution with one place of assembly. These cities were
colonies respectively of Sidon, Tyre, and Aradus. Tripolis was a
flourishing port on a headland which is a spur of Lebanon. It is now
called Tripoli, and is still a large town. See Dr. Smith’s <i>Dictionary
of Classical Geography</i>.</p></div>

called <i>Ceth</i>, and the inhabitants <i>Cittim</i>. Gesenius says, that upon
a Sidonian coin <i>Ceth</i> in Cyprus, which the Greeks called Citium, is
described as a Sidonian colony. <i>Diodorus</i> (xvi. 42) says there were
nine kings in Cyprus. It is probable that the kings of the Hittites
mentioned in 1 Kings x. 29, were from Cyprus. Also the Hittite women
whom Solomon married were probably Cyprians (1 Kings xi. 1). The kings
of the Hittites of whom the Syrians were afraid were also Cypriotes (2
Kings vii. 6); and the <i>land of the Hittites</i> mentioned in Judges i.
26, probably means Cyprus. Josephus, Eusebius, and Jerome understand
these passages to refer to Cyprus. In Isaiah xxiii. 1, the <i>land
of Cittim</i> refers to Cyprus, which belonged to Tyre, the revolt of
which the prophet announced. This revolt is confirmed by Menander
(<i>Josephus</i>, ix. 14, 9).</p></div>

in Homer of their 100 cities. Before the Trojan war lived the famous
king Minos, who is said to have given laws to Crete, and to have been
the first potentate who possessed a navy, with which he suppressed
piracy in the Aegean Sea. The Cretans gradually degenerated, so that
we find in the New Testament St. Paul quoting from their own poet,
Epimenides: “Always liars and beasts are the Cretans, and inwardly
sluggish” (Titus i. 12). The lying propensity of the Cretans is proved
from the fact that the verb <i>to Cretize</i>, was used in Greek with the
meaning “to speak falsely.” In Hebrew, Crete is called <i>Caphtor</i>
(cypress). It is mentioned in Jer. xlvii. 4. It was the native land
of a tribe of Philistines called Caphtorim (Gen. x. 14; Deut. ii. 23;
1 Chron. i. 12). The fact that the Philistines came partly from Crete
is also affirmed in Amos ix. 7. Another branch of the Philistines came
from Casloach in Egypt. The Caphtorim emigrated originally from Egypt
to Crete, from which island they were probably driven by the Greeks.
Tacitus asserts that the inhabitants of Palestine came from Crete
(<i>Historiae</i>, v. 2); and the early name of Gaza was Minoa, after the
famous king of Crete. Another Hebrew name for Crete is Cĕrēth, whence
the inhabitants were called <i>Cĕrēthim</i>. They are mentioned in Ezek.
xxv. 16, and Zeph. ii. 5; where the Septuagint and the Syriac have
<i>Cretans</i>. We find the Philistines, who were partly emigrants from
Crete, called Cerethim in 1 Sam. xxx. 14. From among these Cerethim
and Philistines David chose his body-guard, which was composed of men
skilled in shooting and slinging (2 Sam. viii. 18, xv. 18, xx. 7, 23; 1
Kings i. 38, 44; 1 Chron. xviii. 17).</p></div>

his victory at Issus, and to present him with a golden wreath. (See

from Sidon. For a long time the island was independent, under its own

of Syria, and subsequently under that of the Romans, it retained a
great deal of its commercial prosperity. Aradus appears in Hebrew
under the form <i>Arvad</i>. It is evident from Ezek. xxvii. 8, 11, that
its inhabitants were skilful sailors and brave warriors. They sent out
colonies to Aradus south of Carmel, the island of Aradus near Crete,
and the islands in the Persian gulf. The present name of this island is
Ruad. The Aradians inhabited the mainland opposite the island, as well
as the island itself.</p></div>

Bagoas put Arses and all his children to death; thus leaving no direct
heir of the regal family alive. He then placed upon the throne one of
his adherents, named Darius Codomannus, a descendant of one of the
brothers of Artaxerxes Mnemon. Bagoas soon afterwards tried to poison

height not far from the sea. It was reported to be the oldest city in
the world. It possessed a considerable extent of territory, including
Berytus, and was an independent State for a long period, the last king
being deposed by Pompey. On a Byblus coin of Alexander’s time appears
the name <i>Einel</i>, which is the king Enylus mentioned by <i>Arrian</i> (ii.
20). Byblus was the chief seat of the worship of Adonis, or Thammuz,
who was supposed to have been born there. In the Bible it appears under
its Hebrew name <i>Gebal</i> (mountain-district). The inhabitants of Gebal
are said in Ezek. xxvii. 9 to have been skilled in building ships. In
Josh. xiii. 5 the northern boundary of the Holy Land is said to reach
as far as the land of the Giblite, or inhabitant of Gebal. In 1 Kings

19 the firstborn son of Canaan, <i>i.e.</i> it was the first city founded
by the Canaanites or Phoenicians. It lay about twenty miles south of
Tyre, on a small promontory two miles south of the river Bostremus. We
read in <i>Homer</i> that it was famous for its embroidered robes and metal
utensils, and from other ancient writers we find that it manufactured
glass and linen and also prepared dyes. Before the time of David it
fell under the rule of Tyre; but when Shalmaneser, king of Assyria,
invaded Phoenicia, it revolted from Tyre and submitted to the invader.
It was governed by its own kings under the Babylonian and Persian
empires; and under the latter power it reached its highest prosperity,
surpassing Tyre in wealth and importance. In the expedition of Xerxes
against Greece, the Sidonians furnished the best ships in the whole
fleet, and their king obtained the highest place under Xerxes in the
council. But they revolted against Ochus, king of Persia, and being
betrayed to him by their own king Tennes, they burnt their city and
ships. It is said that 40,000 persons perished in the fire and by the
sword, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 351. (<i>Diodorus</i>, xvi. 43-45). No doubt this barbarous
treatment of Ochus induced the Sidonians to take the side of Alexander.
The city was already built and again flourishing when that king
appeared on the scene. Near the site of the ancient city is the present
town of Saida, with a population of about 5,000. Cf. Homer (<i>Iliad</i>,
vi. 289; xxiii. 741); <i>Lucan</i>, iii. 217.</p></div>

is called the fortress of the sea; and in ver. 8, “Tsor, the crowning
one,” because Tyre gave rulers to the Phoenician cities and colonies.
Valuable information about the power, trade, and customs of Tyre
is derived from Ezek. xxvi-xxviii.; and we learn the fact that she
employed mercenaries like her colony Carthage (Ezek. xxvii. 10, 11). In
the classical writers the name is corrupted into <i>Tyrus</i>, and sometimes
into <i>Sarra</i>. Tyre was unsuccessfully besieged for five years by
Shalmaneser. It was also besieged for thirteen years by Nebuchadnezzar,
and in the end an alliance was formed, by which the Tyrians retained
their own king as a vassal of the king of Babylon. This arrangement was
continued under the kings of Persia.</p></div>

pillars of Heracles, or Straits of Gibraltar, was called Tartessis,
of which the chief city was Tartessus. Here the Phoenicians planted
colonies, one of which still remains under the name of Cadiz. The
Romans called the district Baetica, from the principal river, the
Baetis or Guadalquivir. The Hebrew name for this region is <i>Tarshish</i>,
of which Tartessus is the Greek form. Tarshish was the station for the
Phoenician trade with the West, which extended as far as Cornwall.
The Tyrians fetched from this locality silver, iron, lead, tin, and
gold (Isa. xxiii. 1, 6, 10, lxvi. 19; Jer. x. 9; Ezek. xxvii. 12,
xxxviii. 13). Martial, Seneca, and Avienus, the first two of whom were
Spaniards, understood Tartessus to stand for the south-west of Spain
and Portugal. The word Tarshish probably means <i>sea-coast</i>, from the
Sanscrit <i>tarischa</i>, the sea. Ovid (<i>Met.</i>, xiv. 416); <i>Martial</i>, viii.

of Martial, Ovid, and Tibullus. It never recovered the devastation
committed by Cambyses, who was exasperated by its resistance. The rise
of Alexandria as the capital under the Ptolemies, hastened the decline

by a naval officer, Lieutenant Rawson, who had doubtless studied on
previous nights the relation of these celestial beacons to the course
of our march. The centre of the line was the point of direction;
therefore he rode between the centre battalions (75th and 79th) of the
Highland Brigade. Frequently in the course of the night, after duly
ascertaining what dark figure I was addressing, I represented to him
that his particular star was clouded over; but he always replied that
he had another in view, a second string to his bow, which he showed
me, and that he was convinced he had not deviated in the least from
the proper direction. And he was right, his guidance was marvellously
correct; for his reward, poor fellow, he was shot down in the assault,
mortally wounded. Here we were adrift, but for the stars, in a region

seem to have originally dwelt in Carduchia, the northern part of
Assyria. The Assyrians transported these rude mountaineers to the
plains of Babylonia (Isa. xxiii. 13). The name of Casdim, or Chaldees,
was applied to the inhabitants of Mesopotamia (Gen. xi. 28); the
inhabitants of the Arabian desert in the vicinity of Edom (Job i. 17);
those who dwelt near the river Chaboras (Ezek. i. 3; xi. 24); and the
priestly caste who had settled at a very early period in Babylon, as
we are informed by Diodorus and Eusebius. Herodotus says that these
priests were dedicated to Belus. It is proved by inscriptions that the
ancient language was retained as a learned and religious literature.
This is probably what is meant in Daniel i. 4 by “the book and tongue
of the Casdim.” Cf. <i>Diodorus</i> (ii. 29-31); <i>Ptolemy</i> (v. 20, 3); and

excellence of its water, a fact referred to by <i>Tibullus</i> (iv. 1, 140)
and by Milton (<i>Paradise Reg.</i>, iii. 288). The name Shushan is derived
from the Persian word for lily, which grew abundantly in the vicinity.
The ruins of the palace mentioned in Esther i. have recently been
explored, and were found to consist of an immense hall, the roof of
which was supported by a central group of thirty-six pillars arranged
in the form of a square. This was flanked by three porticoes, each

of a purple colour, half mixed with white, and that no one else was
allowed to wear this mixture of white. He had loose trousers of a

Paras. Cyrus is called Koresh (the sun) in Hebrew; in the cuneiform
inscriptions the name is Khurush. Cambyses is called Ahasuerus in
Ezra iv. 6; and Smerdis the Magian is the Artaxerxes who was induced
by the Samaritans to forbid the further building of the temple (Ezra
iv. 7-24). The Ahasuerus of the Book of Esther is probably Xerxes.
Artaxerxes the Long-handed was the patron of Ezra and Nehemiah (Ezra
vii. 11-28; Neh. ii. 1-9, etc). “Darius the Persian,” mentioned in
Neh. xii. 22, was probably Darius Codomannus, who was conquered by
Alexander. The province of Susiana, previously called Elymais, appears
in the Hebrew under the name of Eilam or Elam. Persis is still called
Fars.</p></div>

confounded his statement. Strabo alone has escaped from the general

of Khawah, Alishtar, Huru, Silakhur, Burburud, Japalak, and Feridun,
which thus stretch in a continuous line from one point to another
along the southern frontiers of Media.” Alexander probably visited the

Xerxes. He also says that Alexander employed 10,000 men in clearing
away the rubbish of the ruins. Professor Sayce and others adduce this
passage of Arrian to prove that Herodotus is not to be trusted even
when he says he had seen the places and things which he describes.
The words of Herodotus are ἐς ἐμὲ τοῦτο ἔτι ἐόν,
meaning, not that he had himself seen the temple, but that
it existed <i>till his time</i>. In chap. 183 he expressly states that he
did not see other things which he is describing, but that he derived
his information from the Chaldaeans. He was about twenty years of age
when Xerxes was assassinated. It must not be forgotten that Strabo
and Arrian lived five or six hundred years after Xerxes. The veracity
of Strabo is never doubted; yet in his description of Babylon this
author speaks of the walls and hanging gardens as if they were still in
existence, though not expressly saying so.</p></div>

in Hebrew. In Gen. x. 11 the foundation of the Assyrian kingdom is
ascribed to Nimrod; for the verse ought to be translated: “He went
forth from that land into Asshur.” Hence in Micah v. 6, Assyria is
called the “land of Nimrod.”</p></div>

Bel</i>: porta vel aula, civitas Beli (<i>Winer</i>). In Jer. xxv. 26; li.
41, it is called Sheshach, which Jewish commentators, followed by
Jerome, explain by the Canon Atbash, <i>i.e.</i> after the alphabet put
in an inverted order. According to this rule the word Babel, which
is the Hebrew name of Babylon, would be written Sheshach. Sir Henry
Rawlinson, however, says it was the name of a god after whom the city
was named; and the word has been found among the Assyrian inscriptions
representing a deity.</p></div>

Alexander swallowed the contents of a large goblet, called the cup of

of Calanus, the Indian philosopher, that it was considered the right

<p><a name="Footnote_985" id="Footnote_985"></a><a href="#FNanchor_985"><span class="label">985</span></a> Dr. Leonhard Schmitz says:&mdash;“Arrian is in this work one of
the most excellent writers of his time, above which he is raised by
his simplicity and his unbiassed judgment. Great as his merits thus
are as an historian, they are yet surpassed by his excellence as an
historical critic. His Anabasis is based upon the most trustworthy
historians among the contemporaries of Alexander, such as Ptolemy,
Aristobulus, which two he chiefly followed, Diodotus of Erythrae,
Eumenes of Cardia, Nearchus of Crete, and Megasthenes; and his sound
judgment as to who deserved credit, justly led him to reject such
authors as Onesicritus, Callisthenes, and others. No one at all
acquainted with this work of Arrian’s can refuse his assent to the
opinion of Photius (p. 73; comp. Lucian, <i>Alex.</i>, 2), that Arrian
was the best among the numerous historians of Alexander. One of the
great merits of the work, independent of those already mentioned, is
the clearness and distinctness with which he describes all military
movements and operations, the drawing up of the armies for battle, and
the conduct of battles and sieges. In all these respects the Anabasis
is a masterly production, and Arrian shows that he himself possessed a
thorough practical knowledge of military affairs. He seldom introduces
speeches, but wherever he does he shows a profound knowledge of man;
and the speech of Alexander to his rebellious soldiers, and the reply
of Coenus, as well as some other speeches, are masterly specimens of
oratory. Everything, moreover, which is not necessary to make his
narrative clear is carefully avoided.” See Smith’s <i>Dictionary of Greek
and Roman Biography</i>.</p></div>
